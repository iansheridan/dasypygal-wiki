## Casual Raiding General Requirements

Guidelines have been posted for specific class related minimum requirements for gear. 

As a Casual Raider you are expected to have a willingness to learn about your class and your class role in any given raid encounter. 

Check your class forum for class requirements and helpful raiding tips (gear minimums, consumables).

 1. Casual Raiders must commit to a minimum of 40% attendance a month for Progression Raids based on the gear requirements in your class sections. Casual Raiders must sign up via the raid calendar. Casual Raiders that are rostered as stand-by will still receive credit toward raid attendance requirements if they are online and ready to raid at the scheduled start time and at least 15 minutes after the raid start time or until released by the Raid Leader.

 2. Casual Raiders must arrive on or before raid start time with equipment repaired, must bring all required consumables (ie potions, bandages, reagents, etc.), and must not be flagged for PVP. Failure to come to a raid prepared may result in removal from the raid.

3. Casual Raiders must keep all required raiding mods up to date.

4. Casual Raiders are strongly encouraged to read up on boss strategies prior to the raid. Consistently ignoring requests to be familiar with boss strategies may result in removal from the raid.

5. Casual Raiders may be removed from the casual raiding rank for inappropriate behavior and violation of guild policies. Raiders must be continually respectful of all players; in-game or in-forums. Casual Raiders will not purposefully cause conflict and when involved in a situation are expected to deal with it in a respectful manner.

6. A lot of helpful information can be gathered from the WWS Reports posted in the raiding forums. As a Casual Raider you're encouraged to review this information as an aid for improving your performance.

7. All Raiders will keep TeamSpeak chatter to a minimum during raids.


If you show a pattern or recent history of not meeting the requirements (vacations and personal issues aside; just make sure you notify the officers), you will be bumped to Non-Raider rank until you can once again commit to the Casual level of requirement.
