I've tweaked the list a little bit to be a bit more legible, provide links, edit out old-world stuffs, etc. 

One thing that's important to consider, esp. for dps types (and this applies to enchants and gems as well as consumables) is that you get more benefit out of strength because of the ways it scales in raids (think blessings of kings for example) over attack power. Keep that in mind as you go about looking for buff items. The raid will thank you later. :)
