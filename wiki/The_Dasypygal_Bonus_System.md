The Dasypygal Bonus System awards players for attending raids by giving them improved odds when it comes time to roll on desirable epic items. There is still a chance for the first-timer to win items, but those who have been around longer and still haven’t won many (or any) items will have a better chance to win. This is further explained in the sections below.

Currently, the Bonus System applies only to 25 man endgame instances



==General Loot and Rolling Restrictions==

#Each person can win no more than one epic, or other significant item (see below) per run. This means that once you win an epic, you cannot roll on any other epics. There are two exceptions:
##Open Rolls. see below.
##Schematics/Recipes/Patterns/Formulas. This rule does NOT apply to schematics, recipes, patterns, etc., though if you’ve already won an epic on that run and a pattern drops, the Gentlemanly thing to do would be to pass and let someone else get loot out of the run.
#In all cases, you may only roll on loot if you can and will use it. You must meet the minimum level or skill requirement at the time of acquiring the item. So you cannot roll on a Tier 1 set piece if you are level 59, and you canot roll on an engineering schematic if your engineering skill is 299.
#Marks of the Illdari, Hearts of Darkness and a few other profession related items go to the guild bank as guild resources. They will be used to gear up our members necessary for raiding progression, at the discretion of the officers.
#Certain epic and legendary quest items will NOT be rolled on. They will be assigned to long-standing and deserving raid members based on a variety of factors. Raid participation is one of the most significant factors, but it is not the only one. History of loot won (taking into account those with runs of bad luck) will also be taken into account, as will progression on other parts of the quest, as well as other “intangibles”.
#A note on off-spec items: During a Progression raid you may only roll on off-spec items if the item goes to open. I.e. If there are others in the raid who want the item and it's a primary spec for them, you must pass. What constitutes an off-spec item? It's based on your current raid role (as defined by your rank). Remember that if you are Core or Casual, it's as a specific role. You are a "tank" or "dps" or whatnot. Any loot that does not fit into that category is, by definition, off-spec. For example, if you are a priest who is designated as a healer, any dps caster gear is considered off-spec. Even if your intention/goal is to switch from holy to shadow, those items will be considered off-spec until you are actually IN the raid as a shadow priest. We understand that sometimes people change their minds about what they'd like to play, and that's fine, but it's only fair that the first opportunity for a specific piece of loot goes to the people who have maintained their current role. i.e. long enough to be Core in that role. Fair loot distribution is important, but it cannot come at the expense of guild progression.
#Special Case for off-spec items: If you have been asked to respec or perform a different raid role by the officership, and an item drops that would normally be off-spec which would be an upgrade, ask the officers about it. In general we'll let you roll, because afterall you are filling a need for the raid and deserve a chance to upgrade. But please consider your future role before rolling. If you only consider yourself a part-time member of that role, you might want to do the gentlemanly thing and pass for a long-standing member of that role. On the other hand, if you plan to fully commit yourself to gearing up for that role and remaining in it permanently, it makes sense to roll on upgrades. Use your discretion, and when in doubt ask an officer for his or her advice.

===Mains Versus Alts===

#As a reminder, the gentlemanly thing to do is to not roll against someone’s main toon.



===Schematics/Recipes/Patterns/Formulas===

#All BoP Schematics/Recipes/Patterns/Formulas can be rolled on by GUILD MEMBERS ONLY.
#All BoP Schematics/Recipes/Patterns/Formulas must be learned on the spot. Do not roll if you cannot immediately learn it.
#Know that rolling on these gives you a responsibility. You MUST make the item for any guild member or raiding partner free of charge if they provide you with the materials. If you leave the guild for some reason in the future, you should still be willing to craft the item for D’Gentlemen members. These patterns are very hard to come by and should be viewed as a guild resource. Do not roll unless you are willing to take the responsibility that comes with it.

===About Open Rolls===

An Open Roll item is one that meets the following conditions:
*No players for which the item is designated for have rolled (they all passed).
*The raid leader announces that the item is up for Open Rolls.

#Open Roll items can be either contested or uncontested, depending on how many people roll. (which affects how much bonus the winner loses.)
#Any class can roll on an Open Roll item so long as they can and will use it, even if they already won an item.
#If you’ve already won an item, and someone else is rolling who has not, it would be gentlemanly to pass or retract your roll.
#As a reminder, the gentlemanly thing to do is to not roll against someone’s main toon.



===Random Epic World Drops===

Random epic drops during a DG raid are subject to all rules prescribed on this page. They are treated no differently than the epic loot we expect to encounter during a raid. 


This means for example that:
#You may use your bonus just like any other epic…
#It results in a loss of bonus just like any other epic…
#It counts as your “one epic per run”…
#You can’t roll if you’ve already won an epic…
#You can’t roll if the item can’t be equipped or if you won’t use it…
#It may be ear-marked for certain classes…
#…and so on and so forth.
The only major significance is that the item must be equipped on the spot if you plan to roll and win the item. If you don’t plan on equipping it immediately after receiving it then please do not roll.

==Accruing Bonus==
#At the end of each raid you participate in, you will receive +5 to your total bonus.
#You will receive this bonus even if you are late or have to leave early, so long as you are an active participant when you are there.
#Non guild members also accrue bonus.
#Bonus is accrued for the following encounters:
##25-man (Gruul's Lair, SSC, TK & Mag)
##Single Encounter World Boss (Doom Lord Kazzak & Doomwalker)
#There are no limits on the amount of bonus you can have.
#At the raid leader’s discretion, players who attended most or all of a particularly difficult raid may be awarded double-bonus — 10 bonus per person instead of 5.




==Using Bonus==
When an item you want drops, and which isn’t prohibited by the Loot and Rolling Restrictions, you have four options:
If you’ve never raided with DG before and you have no bonus, roll 1-100.
#Use all of your bonus and roll X to 100+X. For example, 15-115.
#Do not use your bonus and roll 1-100.
#If you have 80 or more bonus, you may choose to Roll 75-175 (but nothing less!).
#If you use your bonus and do NOT win the roll, there is no cost or penalty.
#Only if you WIN an item, is there a bonus loss. (Please check the Loot And Rolling Restrictions page for exceptions to this list):
#If you roll 1-100 and the item is purple, you lose 25 bonus.
#If you roll 1-100 and the item is blue, you lose 10 bonus.
#If you win uncontested and the item is purple, you lose 25 bonus.
#If you win uncontested and the item is blue, you lose 10 bonus.
#If you roll with your bonus, you lose your entire bonus, which is reset to 0.
#If your bonus is 80 or higher and you chose to roll 75-175, you only lose 75 bonus.
#Your bonus will never go below 0.
#If the item is a BoP or BoE Schematic, Recipe, Pattern, or Formula see the Special Considerations section below.
#Although not frequently exercised, you have the option to use your bonus on anything (Blood Scythe’s, Ragnaros trash, etc.) should you so choose.



===Uncontested Wins===

#An item is uncontested if only one person wants the item (and is therefore the winner by default).
#Uncontested wins still count towards the “one epic per run” rule described in the Loot and Rolling Restrictions.
#Note: “Open Rolls” and “Uncontested Wins” are NOT the same thing.

===Special Considerations for Schematics/Recipes/Patterns/Formulas===

#Make sure you have read and understand the Loot and Rolling Restrictions for these items before rolling.
#You may use your bonus if you choose, with a loss in bonus as described above. However, If you roll 1-100 and win, the bonus loss is ZERO.


==Bonus System FAQ==

'''Q: Why not just use a DKP system?'''

A: There are many reasons to use a DKP system, and many not to. The main reason we chose not to use one? Even the simplest DKP system is too complicated. Spending points, bidding. These are not things that most of the members of our guild are interested in keeping track of. The “game outside the game” as it were. Asking a player to quantify exactly how much they want a particular item can put undue stress on the player. By choosing not to use a DKP system, we make it easier for our members to do what most of them want to do - play the game.


'''Q: So why use a system at all?'''

A: Just because we want to keep it simple for our members doesn’t mean we don’t recognize that a person who attends more raids should have a better chance to win loot. Granted, simply attending more raids will improve your chances of winning even without a system (laws of probability), but we recognize the need for some kind of tangible bonus. Hence the Roll Bonus system.


'''Q: So what exactly is the Dasypygal Bonus System?'''

A: Simply put, it’s a system that rewards players who attend more raids by giving them a better chance to win an item. However, even first-timers have a chance to win any item that drops. Each raid you attend, you receive a +5 to your roll. So the first time you raid, you roll 1-100. Next time it’s 5-105, then 10-110, etc. Whenever you roll on an item, you can choose whether or not to use your bonus. If you do NOT use your bonus, you simply roll 1-100. If you use your bonus and WIN, your bonus is reset to 1-100. If you use your bonus and LOSE, your bonus remains where it is. So basically, your chance to win a given roll will keep going up until you take advantage of the bonus you’ve been building up and finally win a roll.

'''Q: Can I use part of my bonus?'''

A: Normally, you either roll with your entire bonus (40-140 for example) or without it (1-100). The one exception to this is if you have more than 75 bonus. If you have more than 75 bonus you can either roll with all of your bonus (95-195 if you have 95 bonus) or a flat 75-175. If you use all of your bonus and win then your bonus will reset to zero. If you roll 75-175 and win then you will only lose 75 of your bonus. We put this rule in place for those few unlucky individuals who manage to acquire unusually high bonus.

Q: Why wouldn’t I just use my bonus every time?

A: You probably should use your bonus every time you roll, since winning with a 1-100 roll still results in a loss of 25 bonus. However, if you have an 85 bonus and really want a good chance at that OEB or Staff of Dominance, you might want to hang on to your bonus. In this case you could just pass on other epics, or roll 1-100, where winning won’t consume ALL of your bonus. Of course, remember that there are no guarantees. Even with an 85-185 bonus you could roll an 86 and lose it. It’s the nature of the system.


'''Q: How will I know what my current bonus is?'''

A: Whisper Ouiija ingame with !dgb


'''Q: Does your Bonus decay over time?'''

A: Nope. If you raid with us once and get your bonus up to 5-105 and then come back 3 months later, you’ll be at 5-105. (And then 10-110 for the next time you raid with us, whenever that is, etc.)


'''Q: What if I decide to use my bonus but it turns out I am the only one rolling on the item?'''

A: This is what we call an “Uncontested Win”. Winning the loot still results in a loss of bonus (usually 25 for Epic items and 10 for Blue). We do this to prevent too many people from reaching the cap too quickly, which could particularly become an issue when people need fewer and fewer drops from the instance. Also, it’s important to remember that your bonus is not currency. Its purpose is to improve your chances of winning loot, should you have a bad run of luck and not win anything. If you are the only one rolling on an item, your reward is that you don’t have to beat anyone else’s roll! Oh yeah, and that you won an epic too 


'''Q: What if the first person who rolls on an item rolls higher than anyone else is capable of beating?'''

A: This is not the same as "Uncontested". Everyone who wants the item (and is allowed to roll on it based on the loot rules) should still roll, regardless of whether or not they can actually beat the other rolls. Who rolls first should not be a factor in the bonus system; rolling is the method by which you declare your interested in an item (we currently don't have a separate process for declaration because the officers feel it would slow the raid down too much... this ain't AD&D 2nd Edition). Besides, there's no guarantee the person who rolled first will take the item; there are times when the winner chooses to pass (always of their own personal choice...we never ask anyone to do that). Sometimes people roll for the heck of it, but would be willing to pass on the item; if you don't roll, they have no way of knowing you were interested in the item.


'''Q: But if the person with the highest bonus rolls first, aren't I just being an ass by rolling when I can't win?'''

A: No. First, as mentioned above, rolling is how you show the raid you're interested in the item. If you don't roll, no one will know you wanted the item. Second, it doesn't matter. If it's a case where it's obvious to the officers that the only reason people aren't rolling is because they can't win, we'll still deduct the full bonus used from the winner. The "uncontested" rule is ONLY meant to apply to situations where only one person wants the item. There is a difference between "Eh, I'll pass and let him have it" and "Well I want it, but I can't roll higher than him." If necessary, we'll ask the individuals which case it is. But it's really just easier for everyone involved if you just roll on the items you want, regardless of whether or not you can win. As to the person who ends up spending full bonus instead of 25... They've got nothing to complain about. They've won a desirable item, and any time you use your bonus, you should expect to pay it if you win. The reduced 25 cost for uncontested is a bone we throw people who take an item that would have rotted otherwise.


'''Q: Ok, so how is all this different from a DKP system?'''

A: For one, it’s much simpler to keep track of. You go on a raid, you contribute (i.e. you don’t show up for 5 minutes then leave), you get your +5 bonus at the end of the raid. When an item drops that you want a chance at winning, you only have two choices - use your bonus to roll (and risk having it reset to 0 if you win) or don’t use it (in which case you lose 25 if you win). You don’t even have to know what your current bonus is. The raid leaders will track it for you and tell you what it is if you need to know.


'''Q: Why should someone going on a raid for the first time get a chance to roll on an item vs someone who has been on 10 raids?'''

A: Why not? We all have to go on our first raid sooner or later. Furthermore, every person there - first time or 50th time - contributes to the success of the raid. You can’t kill a Molten Core boss with 10 people. You need a large group of people to do it. Every extra person who is healing, dealing damage, removing curses, etc. helps. And these raids aren’t quickie deals. For that particular raid they are putting in just as much time as you are.


'''Q: But the more experienced people that have come to more raids have invested all the time in learning the pulls, repair costs for more wipes, etc. Aren’t they more deserving?'''

A: We all want loot, no question about that. But if it’s the ONLY thing you’re interested in, you’re probably better suited to a hardcore raiding guild. Furthermore, our system does weigh heavily towards veteran raiders. A person rolling 85-185 has a much better chance to beat someone rolling 1-100. So if you’ve put in the blood, sweat and tears and had bad luck with your rolls, the increased bonus ensures that you will get your due.


'''Q: But what about pickup members and alliance guilds? I don’t know these people. They aren’t part of our community.'''

A: But they are helping nonetheless. Everyone who comes on a raid is there to help. If we didn’t need their help, we wouldn’t invite them to come on the raid. Everyone deserves a fair crack at winning for putting in the time for that particular raid. Our reward for being able to cruise through bosses is that we can cruise through bosses. The more we kill, and the faster we do it, the more loot everyone will get - including you.


'''Q: What about making sure the best items go to people that’s “best for the guild”'''

A: It’s a nice sentiment, that works perfectly well in hardcore raiding guilds. But that’s not what we are. With us, you can go on a raid and have a chance to walk away with something, whether it’s your first raid or your 30th. If we only put the focus on a few specific individuals, many more would feel slighted. That said, we do have allowances in our system for “outfitting the guild”. The Lava and Fiery Cores are used primarily for raid progression, so that we can tackle bigger and higher mountains.


'''Q: What about patterns and recipes. Why can only guild members roll on those?'''

A: The patterns and recipes are guild resources. They are extremely difficult to acquire, and given the amount of work our guild puts into making these raids happen, it seems only reasonable that we ensure that if and when one of these patterns drops, a guildmember is able to craft the item. As a friend of DG, you’ll still be able to get the item crafted for you free of charge (with mats). But it’s not fair to the guild to put the responsibility and ability for crafting that rare item in the hands of someone who is not in our guild.


'''Q: What are these epic quest items you are talking about, and why can’t I use my bonus to roll on them?'''

A: Epic quest items include items like the components for the legendary weapon Thunderfury, the components for the epic Priest and Hunter weapon quests that drop in Majordomo’s Chest, Sulfuron Ingot, Elementium Ore, etc. These quests are very difficult to complete, and serve as guild milestones. Furthermore, the one drop in and of itself does not give the person the item. Other tasks need to be accomplished. This all needs to be taken into consideation. Who will be able to complete the quest and obtain the item? Who, through all they’ve done for our raids, has earned these items? Who has had a terrible sting of luck and hasn’t won nearly as much loot as they should have. These and other questions are all fair considerations. This rule is also in place because certain items - these quest items - should NOT go to first-timers. A 1% chance of a random priest who joins us for one raid winning an Eye of Divinity is 1% chance too many. Epic items and epic QUEST items are two separate beasts, and need to be handled separately. Because our standard loot system (the Bonus System) allows for anyone and everyone to win epic items, we need a separate way of handling the quest items.


'''Q: Why are you telling me what items I can and can’t roll on? Like why can’t my Druid roll on cloth +dmg gear that is better than any leather gear I could get?'''

A: First off, read the rule again. We didn’t say you CAN’T roll on it, just that if you do want to roll on an item which is generally thought to “belong” to another class, you should be prepared to give a reason. We’re open-minded and nothing is set in stone. If you are a Balance-spec’d Druid who has focused his gear and talents on dealing more damage, then hells yeah, you should be able to roll on an item that has no equivalent in leather because Blizzard hates boomkins. The reason this rule/guideline is in place is to prevent those who don’t know any better from rolling on an item “for the heck of it”. The important distinction to make is that we are not “telling” you what you can roll on. We are advising you. If you disagree, speak up to the officers, we are a very open-minded crew. Bottom line. if an item drops that you really want and your class isn’t called out, talk to us. We’ll listen.
