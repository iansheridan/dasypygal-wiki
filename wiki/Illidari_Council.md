==Strategy==
In essence this fight is High King Maulgar "2.0" and most of the difficulty is in getting the 'pull' right. The pull is quite complicated and needs to be taken very seriously. 

First and foremost people should have a minimum of 11,000 hp (buffed) entering into this fight. The raid composition MUST have at least 2 mages, and 2 rogues. It also requires a minimum of 2 offtanks and 1 primary tank, the primary tank will need at least 20k buffed hp (which is no real issue at this point). 

The pull needs to be started by a mage with at least 35 yards range on whichever spell they cast. High Nethermancer Zerevor is the target they need to pull, they need to be blessing of protection'd as the spell connects, and they need to spellsteal very shortly thereafter. Gathios needs to be picked up by the main tank as soon as possible (misdirection is an option) and tanked on the side opposite Zerevor. Veras Darkshadow, and Lady Malande can be tanked near the middle of the stairs, about 15 yards from one another. You only need one offtank on Veras, as he does not hit hard. Deadly poison is not dispellable, so make sure to heal whoever gets the debuff. 

The tanking/interrupting of Lady Malande can be rather complex. You will need at least 2 forms of physical interrupts (rogues kick, warriors pummel, etc) and 2 forms of magical interrupt (Felhunter's silence, Shaman's Earthshock, and Mage's Counterspell all work.) The reasoning behind this is because Gathios will usually cast BOP / "Blessing of Spell Warding" on her more than any other target, and due to the nature of this fight (shared health bar) it is essential that NO heals get off. When Blessing of Spell Warding is up your melee dps will need to be on interrupts, and vice versa with Blessing of Protection. 

The tanking of Zerevor is usually done on the left hand side of the platform by a mage. Much like High King Maulgar there is a buff that needs to be spellstolen by the mage or else they will take more damage then they can possibly be healed for. All melee/ranged must stay a minimum of 10 yards away from Zerevor at all times or they will be hit with an arcane explosion. 

Gathios is typically done on the right hand side of the platform, he will be your primary dps target. He will interchangeably have Chromatic Resistance Aura which gives him 250 resist to all schools of magic, and Devotion Aura which increases all the advisors armor by 30%. While the dps is working on Gathios in the right corner they need to watch for 'ground effects' from the other bosses and people caught in them should be healed accordingly. Flamestrike, Consecrate (melee), Blizzard, Empowered Smite, Divine Wrath, and Envenom will all be done at seemingly random intervals. It is possible for someone to have Envenom, get hit with a Flamestrike, and Divine Wrathed at the same time, which is why a minimum of 11k health is advised for this fight
