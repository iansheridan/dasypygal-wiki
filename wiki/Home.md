## Introduction

All policies should promote raid progression. What's the best way to achieve raid progression? Our raiders need 3 things:

1. To be there
2. To learn the encounters (trash and bosses alike)
3. Have the right gear

We used to have a very unique homebrew loot system. Like any other loot system it had it's pros and cons. Over the course of the last year of live-testing the officership came to the determination that we had outgrown our old model.

## Why the change?

We wanted the system to provide more incentive for being a good raider.
You should get extra points for stuff like being on-time, staying for the whole raid, etc. The more you raid, the better your chance to get items that will be of future use to the raid.

## We wanted to put the players in control.

Our new system allows users to bid on multiple items during a single session and also gives a granular level of control over their own points. If that item doesn't mean so much to you then just meet the minimum, if it means a lot then bid more. Hopefully over time this will also encourage people to take more situational or marginally useful items for experimentation as well. 

## We wanted it to be simple and familiar.

The essence of the system should be explainable in a couple sentences. There can still be provisions for various atypical cases and more detailed clarifications, but the system itself should not require pages of reading to understand. A lot of raiders know dkp. It also shows a clear cultural shift that we're a raiding first guild now.

## We wanted it to be scalable.

Specifically, if the system values different items at different costs, it should use a steady constant -- for example item level -- instead of an arbitrary chart created for each particular instance. This way, whenever new loot or instances are introduced, there is no need to update anything or make new determinations as to what things are worth.

## We want it to be fast.

It should be quick in real-time execution. One of the biggest causes for slowdown in a raid is loot. Determining who is awarded loot should be handled quickly and efficiently.

## Awarding

One-time only seed bonus = 400 pts

Being on Time = 5 pts

Boss Learning = 10 pts

First Time Boss Kill = 30 pts

Boss Kill = 15 pts

## A few caveats:

Only players in the guild prior to wotlk can receive the seed bonus. Think of it as a reward for sticking with us over the years. 
The seed bonus will no longer be applied after 1/1/2009. Think of it as a reward for busting your hump to be a valued raider early in our WoTLK progression.

The time in raid bonus is important for us. We want to reward people for their time in the raid whether or not we're wailing on bosses. That said we've hit some serious overhead snags with our current automatic implementation of this bonus. We're looking into options for keeping it alive via a manual route and we're also brainstorming other options for keeping the spirit and intent of this bonus alive. If these alternatives aren't viable then we'll likely increase the points awarded for boss attempt and boss kill by 1 each. We'll keep you all posted on developments.

## Costs

How much an item costs depends on only two factors: it's item slot and it's ilevel. Using Naxx 25 and it's many ilevel 213 items as examples main hand weapons or a chest item may cost 163, boots may cost 121, A necklace, ring, or trinket may cost 88, for all tier tokens we charge a flat 160 dkp.

## Bid Process

UPDATE: This is the addon we use to bid on items in a raid. Its required for all raiders.
[http://www.wowace.com/addons/morg-bid2/ MorgBid2]


When an item becomes available for bidding it's offered up for an auction with it's appropriate cost cited in raid chat or ts to kick off the bidding. To find out how many points you have available to you in real-time at that moment all a player needs to do is ask any officer or whisper the dkp master for that night (usually the raid leader) "'''?dkp'''". 

If the item has no bids then it will go up for auction again with a minimum bid of 24 dkp. We encourage off-specs or dual specs to bid during this second bid process to make sure primary specs have a chance to bid first. If you have fewer than 24 dkp you may bid your available total and cross your fingers. 

In the event of a tie in either the first or second bid phase the tied players only will be asked to bid again. In the rare event that players remain tied and have bid all their available dkp then the players will be asked to do a /roll 1-100 to break the tie. They will be charged the amount they bid for the item.
