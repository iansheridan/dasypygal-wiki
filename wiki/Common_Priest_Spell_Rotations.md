====Warlock Casual Raiding Guidelines====
'''For KZ''': 

'''Affliction:''' The aff build is based almost entirely on dots so spell dmg reigns supreme, maxing out your shadow dmg is the goal try and have at least +900 shadow dmg. The more the better so if you can pump it up to 1200 please do so.
*Spell Damage +900 


'''Destruction builds:''' All destro builds are based on big nukes so spell dmg and crit are key. The more +% dmg dealt from your spec the more leeway in how much +dmg you have to achieve the same results. With +25% dmg dealt good numbers are +700 spell dmg and 23% to crit.
* Spell Damage + 700
* Crit: 23%


'''Demonology builds:''' Depending if your demo/aff or demo/destro set your target numbers based on the other builds. The more +% to dmg you have the less spell dmg you need to achieve the same amount of overall dmg.
