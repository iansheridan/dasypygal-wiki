==Guild Master==
Fenriswulf is the guild master.

==Council==
Council officers manage all guild activities and members. This is an emeritus position. Once you achieve council officer rank you hold on to it unless you choose to give it up.

*Ouiija (Raid Leader & DKP Manager)
*Kiel (CFO : Bank Manager)
*Cailleach (Healing Lead : Raid Log & Wiki Manager)
*Malthran

==Junior Officer==
Junior officer will be a rotating position, supplemental officers who are committed to the raiding aspect of the guild. If a junior officer is no longer able to commit time to helping run and organize raids, he or she will be bumped back to an appropriate rank. As with all rank consideration, if the former officer is once again active, he or she may be moved back to junior officer rank.

*Stromthor (Raid Invites & Attendance)
*Skox (Recruitment Officer)

==Core Raider==
Core Raider means just that -- players who are dedicated to raiding. These players will meet a stringent set of requirements, which include a set amount of weekly attendance. If you show a pattern or recent history of not meeting the requirements (vacations and personal issues aside; just make sure you notify the officers), you will be bumped to Casual rank until you can once again commit to the Core level of requirement.

==Casual Raider==
Casual Raiders are people who like to raid, but can't commit to a stringent schedule. There is more to being a casual RAIDER than a casual player. You must be willing to put in time to upgrade your own gear. If called upon for a raid you will be expected to have the appropriate consumables. In order to maintain the rank of Casual raider, you must attend at least four progression/gearing raids per month.

==Non-Raiders==
Non-Raiders are players that just want to be a part of the community, and don't care so much whether they get to raid or not. You'll be able to enjoy the guild and game at your own pace, and there will never be any expectations of your time and availability. If we have an open spot for a raid and you're interested in coming, you will be able to attend, but ONLY if no one in the other ranks (not including alts) is available. This is also the default rank for players who come to raids and do NOT show the minimum level of commitment to furthering the guild (i.e. you don't bring consumables, you're wearing sub-standard gear that could have been easily upgraded via quests, badges, PVP, etc.)


==Alt. Officer==
The alts of Council and Junior officers. This rank exists so that officers can be in o-chat while logged on as their alts.


==Alt. Gent==
The alts of all other guild members. Alts always have the lowest invite priority for *scheduled* raids. (Non-scheduled raids, invites are at the whim of the person running the raid.)


==Probie==
Probies are new guild members who have yet to be classified as a Non-Raider, Casual Raider or Core Raider. No one will languish in this category for too long -- either you'll be bumped to the appropriate level, or if the guild isn't a good fit for you, you'll be removed from the guild.
