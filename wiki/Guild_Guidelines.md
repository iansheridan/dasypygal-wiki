====General Guidelines====
#Immature behavior outside of jest is look downed upon but will not result in any reprimand unless it is excessive. (Why is this the first rule? Because I don’t want to play with jerks. Simple as that. We are all paying to be in the game and fun should be had by all.)
#Members are always expected to come to another member’s aid if they can. This means they should be willing to put the guild first, when the guild needs help. This also means that a member should not ask for aid unless they really need it.
# Members are expected to be involved in guild activities. These activities are: plain old guild chat, posting in the guild forums, participating in guild raids, assisting other members and attending guild events. Dasypygal Gentlemen is a community, and it is encouraged for everyone to be a part of it.
# It is the responsibility of the member to register with the guild forums. This registration must be made with the screen name of the main character in the guild (ex. “Dagar” is my main character in the guild. “Dagar” is my screen name for the forums)



====Raid Guidelines====
#For all guild-only raids, standard loot rules apply: One blue/purple, one set. Only roll on blue/purple items you can and will use. Only roll on profession items if you have the profession, otherwise roll on any green BoE items that drop.
#In addition to the standard loot rules. If everyone passes on a “bind on equipped” (BoE) blue/purple, the item will be held until the end of the raid and then random rolled for among the people that did not win a blue or set that run. If everyone passes on a “bind on pickup” (BoP) blue/purple, it will be random rolled for immediately. Winning an item in this way does not count as a blue/purple.
#In general we believe strongly in the concept of “Need Before Greed”. Do not roll on an item you intend to sell if someone else in the group/raid can and will use it If no one in the group/raid needs a BoE item, like set Bracers or Belts, consider passing on it so that the raid leader can find someone else in the guild to give it to. (This is NOT a requirement, but has become somewhat standard practice on all-guild raids.)
#Attendance on raids is never a requirement, and you will not be penalized for only being available some of the time. Everyone who comes will have an equal chance to win loot, as every raid will be handled on an individual basis



====Officer Guidelines====
#An officer of the guild is expected to assist members of the guild. As members are expected to help other members, so too is the officer.
#An officer is responsible for recruiting new members and is expected to make current members and new members aware of the General Guidelines (section 1) and Raid Guidelines (section 2).
#An officer is a representative of Dasypygal Gentlemen to all those that are not in the guild and should behave as such. This means that an officer should always be fair and cordial to others.
#Ranks that are considered an officer are: Guild Master, Council and Jr. Officer.



====End-game Raid Guidelines====
#All loot will be handled using the Master Loot system, and no loot will be distributed until the Raid Leader has declared who the item goes to. Do not loot a corpse until the battle is over and all fallen raid members have been ressurrected. Simple guideline — if an item is blue or purple, don’t loot it until you’ve been told you can do so.
#You are encouraged to only roll for items that are a meaningful upgrade for your toon. If an item drops that you can use but is only a minor upgrade at best, consider passing and letting someone who needs it more roll on it.
#If there is some question over whether or not a member of your class should roll on a particular item, send a tell to an officer stating why you think you should be allowed to roll on the item. So long as your reason is better than “because it’s purple”, we’ll be inclined to let you roll on it. However, the officers always have final discretion in these matters. If you are unhappy with a decision (whether it’s because you couldn’t roll on an item or because you didn’t like that someone else could), we encourage you to take it up with an officer after the raid.



====End-game Raid Special Items====
#We currently use [[The Dasypygal Bonus System]] for all our end game runs. You will find any futher information there.

====FINAL DISCLAIMER====

If you have any problems or issues with any of these guidelines, we strongly encourage you to speak up by contacting an officer. Ultimately, the goal is for everyone to have a good time and not get stressed by what, in the end, is simply a game and a alternative social outlet (particularly for us parents that don’t get out much).
