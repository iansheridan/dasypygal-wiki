## General Guidelines
* Immature behavior outside of jest is look downed upon but will not result in any reprimand unless it is excessive. (Why is this the first rule? Because I don’t want to play with jerks. Simple as that. We are all paying to be in the game and fun should be had by all.)

* Members are always expected to come to another member’s aid if they can. This means they should be willing to put the guild first, when the guild needs help. This also means that a member should not ask for aid unless they really need it.

* Members are expected to be involved in guild activities. These activities are: plain old guild chat, posting in the guild forums, participating in guild raids, assisting other members and attending guild events. Dasypygal Gentlemen is a community, and it is encouraged for everyone to be a part of it.

* It is the responsibility of the member to register with the guild forums. This registration must be made with the screen name of the main character in the guild (ex. “Cailleach” is my main character in the guild. “Cailleach” is my screen name for the forums)



## Officer Guidelines
*An officer of the guild is expected to assist members of the guild. As members are expected to help other members, so too is the officer.

*An officer is a representative of Dasypygal Gentlemen to all those that are not in the guild and should behave as such. This means that an officer should always be fair and cordial to others.

*Ranks that are considered an officer are: Guild Master, Council and Jr. Officer.


## FINAL DISCLAIMER

If you have any problems or issues with any of these guidelines, we strongly encourage you to speak up by contacting an officer. Ultimately, the goal is for everyone to have a good time and not get stressed by what, in the end, is simply a game and a alternative social outlet (particularly for us parents that don’t get out much).
