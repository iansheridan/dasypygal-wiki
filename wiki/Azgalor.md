==Strategy==

Get all your dps out on the channeler and the sorcerers (shadow priests and affliction warlocks place their DOTs on all of them) so that phase 2 begins and finish it off. Tank all adds that spawn directly at the spawnpoint, except for the vindicators, they are tanked near akama because they directly run to him. 

When Phase 2 begins, kill the Shade of Akama before he kills Akama. The Shade deals 10 times more damage than Akama but has the same Health points. Akama himself hits him for ~2000 mainhand and ~1000 offhand and he applies an infinitive stacking poison on the shade that produces 5% more damage per stack.
