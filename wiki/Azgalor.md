==Strategy==
The almost universal method/suggested strategy for clearing Hyjal trash is the frequent and repetitive abuse of prot paladins to AOE tank and DPS the majority of the trash. 

Tanking Assingments:
- Prot paladin(s) tanking as many Ghouls, Crypt Fiends as possible
- Ferals and Warriors tanking as many of the Abominations as possible
- Lock/hunter tanking the Frost Wyrm and Gathering Gargoyles
- Sheep as many Necromancers as possible / needed
- Shackle any leftover abominations

The obvious and intended goal is to blow away the large amount of crypt fiends/ghouls while avoiding the more dangerous targets. Key points I've found here is ensuring that your paladin tank who is on the mass of mobs does NOT have abomination aggro as a stun on the paladin while the other mobs beat on him means certain death due to lack of avoidance.

One key point on shadowy necromancer pulls, they will unleash a SB volley at the first target they see. Prot warriors up front during the pull while CC gets established. Spell reflect anything launched at you to provide a nice buffer (4 SBs coming at some poor mage is something yo uwant to avoid, obviously...)

Other than that, everything stated indicates a very clear cut and simple tank and spank type scenario.

==Kiting==
I can't really put this any clearer than a simple picture does. In short, a single hunter will be used to pull a single mob into the alliance NPC camps. Once the mob aggros the NPCs they will assist in the battle. They do horrendous damage but have a large life pool and will ease in the tanking/dps assignments required.


==DPS Order==
The priority targets in terms of raid danger are Necros > Abominations > Ghouls > Fiends > Gargoyles. As such this also makes for an excellent initial kill target order. This is meant for single target DPS. AOE will be...AOEing, and attempting to address the 2nd biggest danger, which is a lack of enough raid DPS to exit combat fast enough and regen for the Nth rounds.

Always DoT Frost Wyrms until it's their turn to die.



==Overview==
Kaz'rogal is down, and while we need to refine and improve on our execution for him, next up on the kill list is absolutely Azgalor, at least Hyjal-wise. The 4th of 5 bosses in MH, this is where I keep hearing the difficulty really ramps up, so we need to be even more prepared for Azgalor before we go in than we have been for the last 3 bosses. Based on our current progression trends, there's no reason we can't take him out in a week or two.

Azgalor is your standard pit lord. He hits very, very hard, similar to pre-nerf magtheridon (if not harder), and also has a couple nasty abilities. Healers - this fight includes the MH standard of copious amounds of raidwide damage, albeit potentially less than other bosses. This fight is going to be a very big test for our tanks and healers.

==Abilities==
Health: 4.2 Million. Seems to be the standard for MH bosses, he has the same health pool as both Anetheron and Kaz'Rogal. Based on our kill of Kaz'Rogal last night, this would be about an 8 minute pace kill. By no means is he a DPS race, but the soft-enrage brought on by Doom (refer below) means that people need to not slack on DPS.

Melee Strength: 7-8k on tanks, supposedly. 

Cleave: Azgalor has a wicked cleave, that is at the very least equal to if not harder hitting than Kaz'Rogal's. It will hit the main tank and anyone in front of Azgalor for upwards of 10k.

Rain of Fire: Deals 1619-1881 fire damage every 2 seconds for 10 seconds and applys an undispellable debuff called Unquenchable Flames that deals 1250 fire damage every second for 5 seconds. This has a 20 yard AOE range. Ranged MUST be spread out to avoid this. It is not uncommon for melee to wear partial FR (200ish buffed) to mitigate this, along with the use of FR totems/auras. The main tank can apparently handle standing in this if needed. As with most magical debuffs it can be avoided with CloS, Ice Block, and Divine Shield.

Silence: AOE Silence with 100 yards range and 5 second duration.

Doom: Without this, Azgalor would probably be a simple tank and spank. Doom is a 100% unavoidable, irresistable debuff placed on players every 45 seconds. The debuff has a duration of 20 seconds, and once it expires, the player dies. It cannot be cast on the main tank. Once the player dies, they will spawn a Doomguard with about 60k HP. This is different in function but IDENTICAL in execution to anetheron. Once you get the debuff, you are to IMMEDIATELY run to the designated doom/offtank spot, which will more than likely be thrall, and die. Do not dps, do not heal, simply run to the spot and die. 

==Positioning==


<need Pic>


As shown above, one preferred strategy is to have an off-tanked area by thrall for doomguards, with a couple healers and 2 OTs. Note the lack of DPS near these people. The NPCs/thrall should be more than enough to handle the doomguards and allow us for maximum DPS time on the boss. Nothing special with the rest of it. Azgalor faces away from the raid, ranged spreads out as much as possible, DPS behind azgalor. I personally think this is the initial way to go position-wise. There are pros and cons to who DPSes doomguards, whether or not to get thrall involved, etc, but in general I believe that we can get far more sustained DPS out of our ranged classes by letting them go all out on azgalor rather than in 60k bursts on doomguards.

==Strategy==

- For at least our first attempt, it is probably wise for melee DPS to wear 2-3 pieces of blue quality or higher FR. Low stat pieces such as necks, and maybe a ring or cloak will allow us to get a feel for not only how much we can resist, but how hard and often the RoF hits. Make no mistake that either way we'll need a fair amount of healing, since it is player targeted and not area-targetted.

- While it's a suggestion for Kaz'Rogal and Anetheron, it should damn near be a requirement for all healers to have at a minimum the SR Buff + BT Neck + BT Cape if possible to mitigate as much of the silence as possible. Due to the nature of their heal styles, it would seem resto druids can get around this at least easier than other classes, so if we have a Heart shortage it would probably be more "efficient" to gear up the other 3 healer classes. Obviously, it goes without saying that a full set of hots is required on the MT at all times, regardless of whether the silence is up or not.

- I have heard pros and cons of using a druid to tank Azgalor. The pros is that you'll take far far less spikes from his physical swings, cons being you'll take SLIGHTLY more RoF damage, and the biggest one is probably that you don't have any oh shit buttons like shield wall/last stand, which I can all but imagine will be needed to at least attain or pad our first killshot. Azgalor does not hit very fast from what I understand, and I do believe he can crush. I'm not sure what kind of shield block uptime a warrior can get up versus a paladin to remain uncrushable, but I can imagine the silence causing some nasty moments. Shields/paper, weigh on viability? I would highly, highly suspect that this would be a good place to throw our best geared warrior tank, at least to start. That being said, I have no idea who that is! Figure that one out, eh. The doomguard tanks can and probably should be anyone, but I would highly suspect that a prot paladin would be a good choice for them due to their low HP totals, overall doomishness, and the fact that there are anywhere from 1-3 up at a given time from what I've read. Seems to cater to a prot, or maybe a feral style best, although this is one fight where we need all the DPS we can get.

- Doom. Obviously this is the one thing that turns a good strat into a shitty strat real ricky tick quick. From what I understand this ability can not be cast on the player with the highest aggro, aka the MT. This means that any of the other 24 of us are free game, including Doomguard tanks, healers, did I mention the doomguard tanks? DPS is DPS, so if one of us gets it that's just more incentive for the rest of us to open up harder. Tank wise, I'm unaware if thrall/taurens can tank the doomguards in terms of aggro. They are absolutely unhealable, but I have no idea if say, our doomguard tank dies at 40% if the rest of the fight thrall can survive/hold the mobs until the end. Until we can figure this out it is probably best to have 1 doomguard OT and 1 backup, or simply 2 doomguard OTs to begin with. Healers are going to have to have the hardest job on this, as per usual, and adjust dynamically, I'm assuming. With a breakdown of 1-2 healers on doomguard tanks, it's possible that might have to drop to 2 with bad luck. The melee will probably need 1 full time dedicated healer, and we probably want the other 4-5 on the azgalor tank. It seems to me that when healers die, we will have to pull assignments SOMEWHERE, and the first place to start will be the doomguard tanks, then the melee. If a third healer dies, uhm.... bubblehearth? Probably drop to 3-4 on azgalor..
