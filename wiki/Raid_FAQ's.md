==How will invite priority be handled for raids?==
Invite priority for all raids (10-man and 25-man) will be as follows:

#GM/Council Officers (Only those classified as Hardcore)
#Sub-Officers
#Hardcore Raiders
#Casual Raiders (including council officers classified as Casual)
#Probies
#Non-Raiders
#Alts

In all cases you must be logged on AS the character you plan to raid with at the time of invites. If you are logged as an alt, you will be skipped over. If you want to raid, get on your main. And remember, class balance trumps all invite priority.
