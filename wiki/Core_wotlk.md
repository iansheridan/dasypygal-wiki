|align="left" | 1. Core Raiders are required to commit to 65% attendance for Progression Raids a month. [http://dasypygal.dyndns.org/wiki/Raiding_Ranks#What_are_the_current_DG_Progression_raids.3F Current DG Progression Raids]
|-
|align="left" |2. Core Raiders will receive priority invite positioning over Casual Raiders. Core raiders are required to use the Raid Sign up Calendar. Signing up for a raid indicates a commitment to be present for for the entire four hour period unless the raid is disbanded early. So its best if we all get in the habit of using it now. Core Raiders that are rostered as stand-by will still receive credit toward raid attendance requirements if they are online and ready to raid at the scheduled start time and at least 15 minutes after the raid start time or until released by the Raid Leader.
|-
|align="left" |3. Core Raiders must arrive on or before raid start time with equipment repaired, must bring all required consumables (ie potions, bandages, reagents, etc.), and must not be flagged for PVP. Failure to come to a raid prepared may result in removal from the raid.
|-
|align="left" |4. Core Raiders must keep all required raiding mods up to date. 
|-
|align="left" |5. Core raiders should check the forums at least twice a week for updates on Guild News and Raid Encounters. Failure to be familiar with boss strategies may result in removal from the raid.
|-
|align="left" |6. Core raiders are expected to take part in the forum discussions on boss strategies and preformance, failure to do so will result in removal from the core rank. 
|-
|align="left" |7. Core Raiders may be removed from the Core Raider rank for inappropriate behavior and violation of guild policies. Raiders must be continually respectful of all players; in-game or in-forums. Core Raiders will not purposefully cause conflict and when involved in a situation are expected to deal with it in a respectful manner.
|-
|align="left" |8. Core raiders are expected to have a willingness to improve and heed helpful advice from the Officer/Jr. Officers.  
*How many arcane bombs were you hit by? 
*How many of your spells missed? 
*Was your over-healing too high or too low for the encounter?. 
*Were you pulling too much agro?   
|-
|align="left" |9. A lot of helpful information can be gathered from the WWS Reports posted in the raiding forums. As a Core Raider you're expected to review this information to improve your performance. 
|-
|align="left" |10. All Raiders will keep TeamSpeak chatter to a minimum during raids.

If you show a pattern or recent history of not meeting the requirements (vacations and personal issues aside; just make sure you notify the officers), you will be bumped to Casual rank until you can once again commit to the Core level of requirement.
