# How to join D'Gentlemen

Welcome, Below you'll find all of the steps you need to apply to DG.

### Membership Requests

We are always open to reviewing potential applicants to round out our raid team. Be aware that some classes are very full in DG such as mages and hunters. Classes like warlocks, shadow priests and feral druids are very light.

If you think that you’re a good fit culturally and raid wise for DG we encourage you to apply even if recruitment is closed.

We also ask that you take a look at our guild wiki and familiarize yourself with our ranks, raiding policies and guild history.
[[http://dasypygal.dyndns.org/wiki/]]

Another step in the right direction would be to register on our forums. We ask that you register with your Characters name, after having registered please contact an officer in game to get your forum account approved. Registration on our forums is required for all members.

We look for involvement in the guild. We don’t mind a shy guild member, but we are looking for people to join our community so your participation is highly valued by all the officers of the guild both in game and on our forums. In joining us in playing this game we join you in playing this game.

### Probation Period (aka: Probie)

You will start out as a Probie for the term of one month. If you haven't registered on the forums yet, you're required as a Probie member to register. Please note whether or not you register and participate on the forums are taken into account at the end of your probation period. Were not looking to drag people along in our raids.. were looking for strong players that know how to raid, laugh, read boss strats, and give 110% when raiding.


To get full membership, the officers will talk about your involvement in guild activities and participation on the Forums. Once we agree that you have fulfilled these requirements full membership is yours. Don’t worry you don’t have to go crazy, we don’t require a tremendous amount of visibility, we just want to know you are there.

### What Classes we are Looking For

We are always willing to open our community to anyone that wants to join D'Gentlemen. Here is a list of classes that we need for our raiding efforts. Be aware that if you apply for a position we do not need for raiding you're not likely to find a spot in our raids.
