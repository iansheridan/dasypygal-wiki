== Optional Raiding add-ons ==
Here you'll find a few of the add-ons that I really like, all of them are optional of course. I thought it may be nice to have a repository of common add-ons :)  If one of your favorite add-ons is not in this list send me a PM and I'll add it. Enjoy!

Raid frames... whatever you use you need a way to quickly see the whole raid so you can cross heal. 


'''[http://www.wowace.com/wiki/Grid Grid]'''

Grid is a modular, lightweight and screen-estate saving grid of party/raid unit frames based on Ace2 and various embedded libraries provided by the Ace-community.

Due to its flexible design, Grid has a fairly daunting configuration menu. I suggest taking a few minutes to look through the configuration and familiarize yourself with the options available to you.


If you don't like Grid you can try:


'''[http://www.wowace.com/wiki/SRaidFrames SRaidFrames]'''

sRaidFrames was designed to replace the raid frames provided by CT_RaidAssist. They share the same look and feel of the original frames, but are highly optimised and even include extra features such as aggro highlighting and display of PVE critical abilities.

'''All of the Ace addons above can be downloaded http://www.wowace.com/files just search for the name of the addon you are looking for.'''



'''[http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=4673 PerfectRaid]'''

Made by a priest on our server actually.

'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/decursive.aspx Decursive]'''

This is a cleaning mod. Its job is to help a class that can remove afflictions to do it with ease in every conditions (playing solo, in small groups or in big raids).



'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/prayer-of-mending-tracker.aspx Prayer of Mending Tracker]'''

A mod that tracks who Prayer of Mending is jumping to and how many charges you have left. Displaying it in a small movable window frame. 



'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/clique.aspx Clique]'''

Clique is a simple GUI that lets you assign click-casting for any number of unit frames. Click casting allows you to define the behavior the game takes when you click on a frame. This can be casting spells, running a macro, using an item, or something as simple as changing targets or assisting a unit.



'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/fortexorcist.aspx ForteXorcist]'''

Spell Timers, Cooldown Timers, Self & Raid messages, Warning Sounds and more


'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/quartz.aspx Quartz]'''

Quartz is a cast bar replacement. The biggest thing that I find useful about it is the latency display. this is what the nice people at ace have to say about Quartz and the Latency Display:

Displays the amount of time spent between cast send and start events, in the form of a bar at the end of your casting bar, with optional text that displays the actual duration of the lag. This helps in canceling casts when they will not actually be interrupted, especially for users with consistently high pings.


'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/omni-cc.aspx Omni CC]'''

OmniCC is an addon that adds text to items/spells/abilities that are on cooldown to indicate when they'll be ready for use once again. OmniCC should be compatible with anything that uses standard cooldown functions.


'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/powerauras-classic.aspx Power Auras]'''

This addon was created to provide visual cues (auras) when you gain buffs, debuffs and many more. Very useful for shorts buffs or debuffs, it allows you to draw in the center of the screen, or around your character, very customizable visual effects, rather than having to look at or mouseover buff/debuff icons/actionbars.
