This is a shadow resistance fight, and it is necessary for members of the raid to have high Shadow Resistance. 

There are two strategies for this encounter: One Group and Three Groups. 

==One Group==
All casters / healers stands beneath the right hand pillar near Mother Shahraz. She is tanked at the opposite pillar facing along the the terrace with melee behind her, this avoids parries when she turns to cast beams (except directly at the melee) which can be deadly as she deals nasty damage to the main tank. Standing underneath the pillar also has the bonus that when players are knocked up by the Sinister Beam they hit the top of the pillar and take slightly less fall damage. 

Offtanks stand directly on top of the MT and try to use a ranged weapon or skill to attack the boss before she reaches the MT, otherwise you will not be in combat and the saberlash will not be split between them, 1 shotting the MT. 

People with fatal attraction must take care to run AWAY from the tanks or the caster groups, and then take a healthstone. It is recommended to put down a [Shadow Protection Cauldron] at the start of the encounter for everyone as well. 

Advantages: More space for people with fatal attraction to run around in. 
Disadvantages: It is possible for 3 people with fatal attraction to be teleported in to the caster group, this will do some nasty damage potentially causing a wipe 
Another tactic is to gather everyone and stand under Mother Shahraz's skirt. This involves everyone in the raid group running "under" Mother Shahraz and fighting/healing from there. 

Advantages: Few/none will be hit by the beams 
Disadvantages: It is possible for a wipe if one person does not stand DIRECTLY under her skirt. 
==Three Groups==
The casters / healers are split into three groups which are placed at equal angles and distances around the boss. 

Advantages: if a bad fatal attraction occurs at most one group will be hit. 
Disadvantages: it is much more likely a group will be hit by fatal attractions, and people with the attraction have less space to run apart. 
==Craftable Resistance Gear==
This fight requires that players have a high level of Shadow Resistance. A list of craftable resistance gear suitable for this fight and materials required can be found at Mother Shahraz/Shadow resist gear.
