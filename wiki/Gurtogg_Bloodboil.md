==Abilities==
In phase 1, Gurtogg uses his Bloodboil ability 5 times. This phase lasts 60 seconds: 10 seconds before the first Bloodboil, and 10 more seconds after each Bloodboil. Phase 2 begins 10 seconds after the 5th Bloodboil, when he casts Fel Rage on a random raid member and aggroes onto that raid member for 30 seconds. After that, he returns to the top target on his threat list and phase 1 starts again. The fight continues in this 90 second "loop" until Gurtogg is defeated. 




==Phase 1 Abilities==
Bloodboil - A damage over time (DoT) which ticks for 600 physical damage every 1 second, for 24 seconds. This damage is reduced by resilience and the Warlock talent Shadow Embrace. 
Acidic Wound - Applies a stacking debuff to the current Main Tank every 2 seconds, which lasts for 60 seconds and is refreshed each time a new stack is applied. Reduces the armor of the tank by 500 and ticks for 250 damage per stack, stacking up to 99 times. As the Acidic Wound dot is classified as Nature damage, it cannot be removed by any means including Blessing of Protection, except for complete invulnerability abilities like Divine Shield, Iceblock, etc. This ability can be avoided (dodge/parry/miss), slowing the speed at which the tank's debuffs stack. 
Eject - Disorients the current Main Tank (similar effect to Hunter's Scatter Shot), causing him to lose aggro for 5 seconds. 
Knockback - Knocks the current Main Tank back, reducing his threat. 
Arcing Smash - A powerful melee cleave attack that strikes all targets directly in front of the boss. It hits for about 5,000 damage in phase 1. He uses it about once every 10 seconds. Unlike most boss's "cleave" abilities, the area of effect of Arcing Smash is very small (about 3-4 yards). In phase 1, Arcing Smash will often also apply the Acidic Wound debuff, refreshing the stacks on tanks that are hit by it. 
Fel Acid Breath - Nature debuff applied in a wide cone in front of the boss, with a moderate range of about 10 yards. Deals roughly 8000 nature damage over 10 seconds. Resistible. In phase 1 Gurtogg will turn to cast this on a random target in melee range (including pets), making your melee DPS and any casters who find themselves too close susceptible to this dot. 
==Phase 2 Abilities==
Arcing Smash - A powerful melee cleave attack that strikes all targets directly in front of the boss. It hits for about 12,000 damage in phase 2. It also applies a "Mortal Strike" debuff that lasts for 6 seconds and reduces healing effects by 50%. He seems to only do this once or twice during each Fel Rage. 
Fel Acid Breath - Nature debuff applied in a wide cone in front of the boss, with a moderate range of about 10 yards. Deals roughly 8000 nature damage over 10 seconds. Resistible. During phase 2, Gurtogg will only cast this on the Fel Rage target. 
Fel Rage - Places this 30 second debuff on a seemingly random (not applied on warriors) raid member every 90 seconds. Gives players affected by Fel Rage the following effects: 
- increases armour by 15,000 
- increases health by 30,000 
- increases healing done by 100% 
- increases damage done by 300% 
- increases size by 100% 
Gurtogg himself will also gain Fel Rage at this point, which is buff on himself that increases his damage done, and stacks higher and higher over the course of phase 2. By the time the Fel Rage is nearly over, Gurtogg's melee damage will be exceedingly high, enough to quickly gib a normal tank if the Fel Rage player dies. During Fel Rage, he will only attack the raid member with the Fel Rage debuff, until they are dead or the Rage has worn off. Gurtogg is incapable of critting during Fel Rage. 

Acid Geyser - Used when phase 2 begins, this ability targets the Fel Raged person and deals 5k nature damage to that person and all raid members within 5 yards of them. 
Insignificance - All abilities used when this debuff is applied cause no threat. This is cast on the entire raid at the start of Phase 2. The target with Fel Rage will not show as having Insignificance, but still their actions during phase 2 will not affect their threat level. This ability is resistible! Be careful to ensure that you have Insignificance before going all DPS on Gurtogg in phase 2. 
Encounter Enrage Timer: 

Berserk (Hard Enrage): - After 10 minutes Gurtogg will go berserk, giving him a 500% damage increase and a 150% attack speed boost, killing the entire raid in VERY short order. 
==Strategy==
Raid makeup for this fight is variable, depending on how much experience your guild has with the fight. Guilds that are still learning the fight should bring 9-10 healers, as this is by far the most healing intensive fight you'll have seen (even more than Najentus). The enrage timer is rather generous, so losing a few DPS slots to healers is not a big deal. Paladin tanks have a significant disadvantage in this fight, since their threat generation is very bad when not main tanking, so bringing feral druids and warrior tanks is advised. Feral druids actually have an advantage as OTs in this fight due to their good rage generation while offtanking. 

Just before the fight begins Mages may wish to put Amplify Magic on the whole raid. Bear in mind Fel Acid and Acid Geyser are magical damage, but the benefit of Amplify Magic will outweigh the extra damage taken. 

The fight can take take place in one of 2 places: on the ramp into Gurtogg's spawn area, or in the area directly in front of Gurtogg, between the waterfalls (instructions for the waterfall location will appear in parenthesis). Since Gurtogg's starting location is far from the ramp, the pull that to the ramp requires a hunter to Misdirect Gurtogg to the MT. A Misdirect pull is also advised for the waterfall area, as it will help keep the healer's from aggroing as the fight begins, and let the OTs stay behind the MT on initial threat. 

The three tanks should position themselves with backs to the wall (waterfall) on the right. Hunters should be ready with misdirects for the offtanks, to help with their threat generation, since they won't be gaining nearly as much rage as the MT. 

Notice the obvious darker area on the left of the ramp (the trough area in front of the opposite waterfall from the tanks). Bloodboil targets the five farthest raid members, so the groups should move away into this darker (trough) area of the floor when it is their turn to take bloodboil. The rest of the raid should stay out of the darker area (trough). It is safe to get within about 10 yards of Gurtogg, so casters should utilize the area around him in order to stay closer than the bloodboil sponges. It's very easy to be farthest away from Gurtogg by being too far to the left or right, and end up taking a bloodboil when you didn't want to. Be careful to avoid this. 

Gurtogg should be facing away from the raid, so the melee are not affected by his Arcing Smash ability. 

==Phase 1==
For the tanking strategy, see below. 

10 seconds after you engage Gurtogg he will apply bloodboil to the 5 members of the raid furthest away from him. This debuff deals a sizable amount of damage over time (600 per second for 24 seconds, for 14400 damage in total), and will need to be healed up quickly and efficiently. 

Assign 3 groups in the raid who will be bloodboil 'sponges'. These groups will take it in turns to take the debuff, to avoid it stacking multiple times. 

For example, groups 3, 4, and 5 are assigned to take blooboils. At the initial pull all the members of group 3 make sure they are furthest away from the boss compared to the rest of the raid. As soon as they have taken bloodboil, they move in closer to Gurtogg (to avoid taking any more bloodboils), and group 4 moves back to take the next bloodboil. When group 4 has the debuff, they move in close and group 5 moves back. Once group 5 has the debuff, group 3's bloodboils will be gone, and they move back to take the next one, and so on. 

Gurtogg will cast the bloodboil debuff 5 times in phase 1, in 10 second intervals. Healers should be assigned to the groups in order to counteract the damage from the DoT. Shaman's Chain Heals are very effective in healing the damage, druids' are very effective in countering the DoT with HoTs, and Circle of Healing priests really shine in this fight. 

It is very important that the groups assigned to take blooboils move when they are supposed to. 

For DPS classes: you must watch your threat generation. The boss is not Taunt-able and will Disorient the main tank causing him to lose aggro momentarily, as well as knocking the tank back, reducing his threat. Because of this, DPS must not go above the offtanks in their threat levels. For the first 60 seconds it is highly recommended that DPS classes go very slowly in terms of their damage done. Melee classes also need to be aware that Gurtogg will in all likelihood turn around at the start of Phase 2, so moving out of his way 5 seconds before he changes Phase is a good idea, to avoid taking unnecessary damage from Arcing Smash. 

Healers will need to be very alert to who is taking damage, and assignments must be made as to whom to heal. The tanks will be taking massive amounts of damage, and it is recommended that 6 tank healers are used: 4 on the main tank and 1 for each offtank to keep them alive. 3 healers should be enough to cover the Bloodboil damage. Be aware of course that the main tank will change during the fight; healers need to be ready for this. A macro that target's Gurtogg, then assists him and casts a heal on that target will help immensely in healing through tank transitions. 

As Gurtogg casts the 5th application of bloodboil the whole raid should spread out, in order to minimize the damage from Acid Geyser, detailed in Phase 2. Do not spread too far; make sure everyone is in range of healing. 

==Tanking Strategy, Phase 1==
Tanks have a very hard job in this fight. Gurtogg is not Taunt-able, and all 3 tanks will need to build as much threat as possible. Early in the fight it is advisable for warrior and paladin off-tanks (and feral druids, to a lesser extend) to take Arcing Smash a few times on purpose, in order to gain rage/mana and get a few stacks of the Acidic Wound Debuff, before moving off to the side. The small amount of damage from 1-2 stacks of Acidic Wound will feed them rage/mana and allow them to maintain a greater TPS than if they weren't taking any damage at all. Fel Acid Breath will also sometimes provide them with additional damage intake, but since it's cast on random targets in melee range, you can't rely on it for rage/mana generation. 

The main tank will receive a stacking debuff called Acidic Wound, which lasts for 60 seconds. Gurtogg attempts to stack this debuff every 2 seconds, but it can be avoided, slowing the speed at which the stacks build up. This debuff will reduce the tank's armor and tick for increasing amounts of damage to the point where it is no safe to continue tank (for example, this debuff ticks for 5k damage and reduces the tank's armor by 10000 at 20 stacks). That tank must lose aggro and then stay off to the side to avoid Arcing Smash, while still gathering as much threat as he can in order to stay above the DPS, until his stacks of Acidic Wound fall off. Since Gurtogg is not Taunt-able, having all 3 tanks at the top of the threat list is a necessity. 

Sooner or later, he will Disorient his primary target, leaving them unable to act for 5 seconds. It is at this point that he will switch to the next highest on his threat list. This needs to be a tank, otherwise he will run rampant through the raid, causing a wipe. 

This is the strategy through phase 1, switching the tanks as he Disorients them or knocks them back. However it is worth noting that Disorient is (seemingly) random. He may well do it twice in 10 seconds, or not do it during the phase at all. Also, a tank with good avoidance is likely to avoid a lot of Disorients anyway. Because of this, tanks need to be aware of each others' threat and stay not only the top 3 on the threat list, but also close to each other's threat levels. If one tank is way ahead in threat, he won't lose aggro from Gurtogg's abilities alone. Such a tank may well need to stop attacking entirely, in order to go lower on Gurtogg's threat list. Gurtogg will do his knockback (which is also avoidable) every 15 seconds or so, but this is not always a guaranteed loss of aggro whereas Disorient is. 

Paladins can use Blessing of Protection on the tank if need be, to ensure that Gurtogg stops attacking that tank, but this should not be necessary; Gurtogg's own threat reduction abilities should be more than sufficient for tanks to lose their aggro (unless they are stacking avoidance, which is explained later). 

Once you have mastered the strategy, Gurtogg can be done with only 2 tanks, although this is far riskier; a combination of a Disorient on one tank followed by a knockback on the other will likely cause the DPS to take aggro. 

Because all of Gurtogg's abilities can be avoided, stacking avoidance for this fight is a double-edged sword. More avoidance means slower Acidic Wound stacking, but it also means the tanks will avoid Disorients and knockbacks often enough that they may not lose aggro when they need to without additional countermeasures. Having the current MT stop attacking entirely will help the OTs take aggro away from him, allowing his Acidic Wound stacks to eventually fall off. 

==Phase 2==
As soon as Gurtogg casts Acid Geyser, phase 2 has begun. Acid Geyser will target a random person in the raid, and that person will be affected by Fel Rage. The Fel Raged player should not move at all during the phase, helping to ensure that no one else in the raid is hit by the frontal cone attacks that Gurtogg will be using on him. 

If the raid has spread out well immediately after the fifth bloodboil of phase 1 then the effects of Acid Geyser will be minimal, but it is extremely important that all healers know who it is that has Fel Rage, as that person will be the focus of Gurtogg's attacks for 30 seconds, or until they die. 

Gurtogg moves quite fast; about the speed of an epic land mount. As he lumbers off to attack the Fel Raged person, there are several things that need noting: 

There are still Bloodboil DoTs ticking on 2 groups. 
The tanks are still taking damage from the Acidic Wound DoT. 
The Fel Raged person will be taking many of his close range abilities: Arcing Smash, Fel Acid, and his normal attacks. 
Obviously this means that raid healers need to be working hard. 

The main focus should be the Fel Raged person. No matter which class is targeted by this, they will require massive amounts of healing. At least 6 healers should switch to the Fel Raged person immediately, and spam them with their biggest heals. During phase 2 mana efficiency takes a back seat to pure healing per second being applied to the Fel Raged player. Do not underestimate how hard Gurtogg will hit the Fel Raged person though (up to 20k crushes can and will happen, especially on cloth-wearing classes). 

It is most important that the Fel Raged person does everything in their power to keep themselves alive. Healing effects are increased by 100%, and this also includes Healthstones and Potions. Any way that classes can absorb damage, slow Gurtogg's attacks, or heal themselves should be used. Detailed class instructions for Fel Rage can be found below. 

If the Fel Raged person should die then Gurtogg will return to the highest on his aggro list (one of the tanks). If this should happen the tank in question will probably need to Shield Wall in order to survive his attacks, as his damage is increased significantly from his own Fel Rage buff. It is in the raid's best interest not to let the Fel Raged person die, as with their 30k extra HP, they are far better suited to take Gurtogg's attacks than the tanks are. 

Gurtogg will also return to the highest on his aggro list if the Fel Raged person uses an immunity effect like Iceblock or Divine Shield. 

A final note regarding Fel Rage: move away from the affected target. People standing too close can be hit by Arcing Smash and Fel Acid. This is another benefit of spreading out at the end of Phase 1. 

During Phase 2 DPS should be maximized. The whole raid will have the Insignificance debuff, which makes your abilities cause no threat. Because of this, DPS should go full out and burn him down as much as possible. Use all cooldowns and trinkets in order to do as much burst damage as possible. Save bloodlusts/heroisms for phase 2. 

Do note however that Insignificance is resistible, so check you've got it before going all out on Gurtogg. 

After 30 seconds, phase 2 and Fel Rage will end, and Gurtogg returns to Phase 1. If he has moved during Phase 2, it is advisable to get out of the path between him and the tanks, as he can Arcing Smash on his way back to them. 

Rinse and repeat to get him down. Be aware of his 10 minute enrage timer which will cause a wipe should he reach it. 

Gurtogg is a very difficult encounter to learn, and a fairly hard one to execute correctly. Depending on your raid setup it may take quite some time to master. 

==Class instructions for Fel Rage==
Druid: If you are restoration specced and targeted with Fel Rage your best bet is to hit Barkskin and heal yourself. Keep all HoTs up, and be ready to use Swiftmend/Nature's Swiftness. If you are Feral, go Bear Form immediately. Frenzied Regeneration will heal for double the usual amount, use it wisely. Keep Demoralizing Roar up, and damage him as much as you can. 
Hunter: Hit Aspect of the Monkey as soon as possible. Damage him with your melee attacks. 
Mage: Use of health potions and Healthstones is necessary (the healing buff makes them very strong). Also, put Ice Armor on as soon as possible. Slowing his attacks by 25% may well save your life. If specced into deep frost, use Ice Barrier as often as you can. It is advisable that all mages use Mana Shield to prevent as much damage to themselves during the Mortal Strike effect as they can. An OOM mage is a whole lot better than a dead mage. Use instant or uninterruptible attacks such as Fire Blast or Ice Lance on him. Do not use Iceblock. 
Paladin: Keep casting as many heals on yourself as possible. Do not use Divine Shield. If you are Retribution, still heal yourself if you notice that you are low on health, but you should be able to do some damage. 
Priest: Use Power Word: Shield every time it becomes available. Keep Renew up and chain cast Flash Heal on yourself. Be ready with Desperate Prayer if you have it. Shadow priests should use Vampiric Embrace and damage him as much as possible. 
Rogue: Burn your cooldowns to damage him as much as possible. Hit Cloak of Shadows when he uses Fel Acid on you. Save Evasion for when you get the Mortal Strike debuff, since if you blow it right at the start it won't last long enough to get you through the whole phase. Do not Vanish. 
Shaman: If you are restoration, put Earth Shield on as soon as possible and heal yourself constantly. If you are enhancement/elemental it may well still be advisable to heal yourself as much as your mana will allow. If the other healers are comfortable however, you might be able to do some damage. 
Warlock: Chain cast Drain Life. Keep casting and recasting it even though it will be interrupted. Keep up Siphon Life if you have it, use Death Coil when you're low on HP. 
Warrior: Evidence suggests that warriors are never given Fel Rage, but just in case: Switch to Defensive Stance and equip a shield. Do not use Death Wish. 
==Tips==
Pain Suppression is really useful spell against Fel Rage. If your raid is having a hard time keeping Fel Rage tanks up, having a priest spec into it will be useful.
