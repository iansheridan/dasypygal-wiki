## Raid Sign-up
All Core and Casual members who wish to raid must use the in game calendar. Using the calendar lets us see who is available and what the raid composition will look like at invite time, it allows the raid leaders to know what spots we may be lacking and where we may have an excess. As always please let an officer know if you are going to be late, please do so by posting on the forums.

If you are a non-raider or probie who is working on obtaining Casual or Core Raider status please take note of our raid times and talk to Ouiija about being added to the calendar. You should inform an officer of your intent to change your raiding status and be ready and available at the zone for invite times.

## How will invite priority be handled for raids?
Invite priority for all raids (25-man) will be as follows:

* GM/Council Officers (Only those classified as Core raiders)
* Junior Officers
* Core Raiders
* Casual Raiders (including council officers classified as Casual)
* Probies
* Non-Raiders
* Alts

In all cases you must be logged on with your main at the time of invites. If you are logged as an alt, you will be skipped over. And remember, class/role balance trumps all invite priority.
