==Purpose==
Acquaint everyone with the basics of the first fight in black temple. We're more than likely one or two weeks away from stepping foot in there, so this gives us plenty of time to do an initial assessment of the fight.

==Introduction==
Naj'entus is another one of those "really simple fights in theory" that winds up being another "Holy crap look at all the raid damage that the healers have to suffer through". Looking at this fight, the execution is VERY, VERY simplistic, and it appears that for all classes but healers 99% of the work is done with preparing for the fight, as the execution is very static and simple. The 10-cent version of the fight is as follows: Raid spreads out. Raid DPSes boss. Susbstantial AOE damage occurs. Players 'loot' other players who get hit with a special ability (similar to Vashj cores). Raid uses item looted to break damage shield, raid takes more aoe damage. Rinse/repeat.

==Abilities==

Naj'entus has 3 primary abilities, almost all of them being AOE-centric. I know, healers, you're thrilled about this.

'''Needle Spine''': RSTS missile fired at 3 targets. 3890-3910 physical damage dealt. 2280 to 2500 frost damage is done to everyone around them. Spreading out is obviously key to addressing this and is dealt with in the strategy section. Used FREQUENTLY.

'''Impaling Spine''': RSTS missile fired at 1 target. Deals 4513-4987 physical damage and stuns the target. While stunned the target takes 2750 damage per SECOND. To mitigate this, you need to run up and click the spine ''(cog-like, much like any other use item)'' from melee range, and loot the spine into your inventory.

'''Tidal Shield''': Used every 60 seconds. While under the shield his only attacks are standard melee. While shielded he is 100% immune to all forms of damage and will regenerate 1% of his total health every 2 seconds. This shield must be broken with the impaline spine looted from players hit with it. To do this simply throw the spine at naj'entus, snowball style ''(must be within 10 yards of the Warlord)''. When the shield breaks, the raid takes 8500 aoe frost damage. This is resistable by CloS, Ice Block, and Divine Shield.

==Strategy==
This looks to be a very, very basic fight in execution. 

At 0:20 into the fight, the first impaling spine goes out. This happens again at 0:40. At 1:00 his shield goes up. At 1:20 a spine goes out, at 1:40 a spine goes out, and at 2:00 his shield goes up. Rinse/repeat until his hard enrage at 8 minutes. Note that the normal, aoe-type spines are not on timers and presumably randomly spammed throughout the fight.

- Due to the nature of tidal shield, EVERYONE needs at least 10,000 HP buffed.
- The raid will require either 1 MS warrior, or rogues with wound poison to mitigate the shield heal.
- Everyone must be topped off BEFORE the shield is broken
- CloS, Ice Block, Divine Shield every time the cooldown is up for tidal shield to mitigate healing strain

The fight appears to be ALL about positioning, spreading out, and allocating healers to zones to where they can reach enough players without moving. It appears to be very, very healing intensive and also a slight DPS check. Naj has 3.6 million HP and an 8 minute enrage timer. Assuming he doesn't heal a single point of health (which is possible but probably unlikely), the DPS requirements for this fight are (3,600,000 / (60 * 8)) = 7500 RDPS.

He will tidal shield every minute at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 minutes in, for a total of 8 shields. Presuming full wound poison/MS, and a rate of 0.5%hp/2 secs, say worst case scenario it takes us 10 seconds to nuke the shield, he'll restore 2.5% of his health every minute, and 20% of his health for the entire fight. This would bring his effective health up to 4.32 million and require exactly 9000 RDPS to take him down. 

So, obviously, the big things of this fight are very intense raid healing requirements, acquisition of spines off players in the first place, and then breaking the shield with the spine in a timely fashion. I think we are definitely capable of coming in the 8500 RDPS region on this fight once we get there, so not only do we have plenty of DPS to get him down in time if we do a decent job on the shields, if we do an amazing job on the shields our healers will thank us greatly.
