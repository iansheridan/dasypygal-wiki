Signing up for a raid indicates a commitment to be present for for the entire four hour period unless the raid is disbanded early. So its best if we all get in the habit of using it now. Core Raiders that are rostered as stand-by will still receive credit toward raid attendance requirements if they are online and ready to raid at the scheduled start time and at least 15 minutes after the raid start time or until released by the Raid Leader.

==Raiding Rank FAQ's==
===How do I change my rank?===
If you wish to be designated as a Non-Raider, you need only ask any officer online to make the switch. Your rank will be immediately switched.


If you wish to move from Non-Raider to Casual Raider, you must meet the minimum requirements of the Casual Raider, which means you must have attended at least three 25-man raids in the past month. If you are having trouble getting into raids, make sure the officership is aware of your desire to change rank. If you show the proper commitment (by signing up even though you may not have a spot, always having consumables at the ready, making an effort to upgrade your gear via 10-mans, heroics and PVP, etc.), your effort will be recognized, and the attendance requirement may be waived.


If you wish to move from Casual Raider to Core Raider, you will need to show a big willingness to commit. Here attendance WILL matter. If you're not able to get into raids because the slot for your class/race is already full, that will tell you something -- there simply isn't room currently in the Core Raiding rank for your particular class/role. If there is a shortage of your role, then you should be going to just about every raid available. That in and of itself will show your commitment.


Alternatively, your rank may have changed due to your lack of availability. If you were a Core Raider who was moved to Casual because you had to take time away from the game (for whatever reason, personal or otherwise), prevail upon the officership. If you are able to demonstrate that you are once again able to meet the attendance requirements and are committed to raiding as much as you were in the past, you will be moved back to your Core rank.


Your rank is a reflection of your CURRENT status; so if you're not playing the game right now you won't be classified as hardcore. But if you come back full force, your past contributions will not be ignored or forgotten. Real life ALWAYS comes first. So don't take it personally if your rank changes. It's only a reflection of how available you have been (or have not been). So long as you are willing and able to resume your previous level of involvement, your previous rank will be reinstated.

===Can I go directly from Probie Rank to Core Raider?===
Absolutely. If you join the guild and start actively attending raids right away, and meet the Core Raider requirements, you may (and probably will) be bumped directly to Core Raider status. Again, your rank is a reflection of your involvement in the guild; if you are attending 4-5 raids a week and helping the guild progress, you are a hardcore raider.


===Can I go directly from Non-raider to Core Raider?===
Unlikely. Probably only if you were moved to Non-Raider status due to inactivity. If you have been playing the game but have stayed away from raiding, you'll need to make the bump to Casual first, to start to show your commitment to what will in reality be a change in philosophy and approach to the game. If you've been around for a long time but haven't been committed to raiding -- well that's fine, you are a welcome member of our community -- but to make the jump to Core Raider, above those already classified as Casual Raiders, you will need to begin by showing a level of commitment you previously didn't have.

===What happens if I want to switch my main?===
If you choose this course of action, a few things will happen. First, your current main will be moved to the ALT rank. Second, your Alt character will be moved to the Probie rank. Based on your availability and participation in raids, in the next few weeks you will be moved into the Core, Casual or Non-Raider rank, just as any other Probie would be. Unless you are specifically asked by the leadership to switch your main, or it is done so with their blessing, no special dispensation will be made for your new status. If you switch your main to a healer, you will have the same chance of getting into a raid as other healer probies. Such is the way if you choose to switch your main by your own decision.


If you are asked to switch your main to the benefit of the guild, you will not be put into the probie rank. You will be in a rank appropriate to your contribution, which could be as high as Core Raider, if you were already a Core Raider who was asked to switch mains for the good of the guild.

===What happens if I want to change my raid purpose?===
Switching raid purpose means the following:
* Switching Specs from Healing to DPS 
* Switching Specs from Tanking to DPS 
* Switching Specs from Tanking to Healing
* Switching Specs from Healing to Tanking
* Switching Specs from DPS to Healing
* Switching Specs from DPS to Tanking


There are only a few classes that can effectively make this kind of purpose change; Priests, Druids, Shamans, Paladins & Warriors.
