==Purpose==
Acquaint everyone with the 2nd encounter in Black Temple. Najentus is down, 3/5 Hyjal is a one night farm deal, and we absolutely have more on our raiding plate to come. Azgalor's next, and Supremus is sure to be right along. Get up to speed quick.

==Overview==
Imagine gruul. Now imagine gruul superimposed on top of big bad wolf. Throw in some pathetic raid damage because everyone likes to GET OUT OF THE FIRE, and you have supremus. Seem a bit sarcastic? It's not far off - and yes, supremus is one of the 'easier' encounters in BT. We have downed Naj, as long as we come prepared, supremus will die.

Supremus is a 2 phase fight. Phase 1 is your 'Gruul' tank and spank. Phase 2 is your BBW-style kiting phase. These phases rotate every minute or so until he either dies or enrages.

==Abilities==

'''Health''': 4,500,000+

'''Enrage Timer''': Unknown?

'''Molten Flame''': Blue Fire on the ground. Ticks for 3k/second. Get out of the fire. Used in phase 1 and phase 2.

'''Geyser''': emotes "The ground begins to crack open!" and begins to summon volcanoes on the ground, which tick for 4500 fire damage. Amazingly similar to molten flame. Get out of the fire. Used in phase 2 only

'''Gaze''': Identical to BBW/Thaladred: Moves at 90% movement speed, focuses on a single target for 10 seconds. Entirely random. Switches targets every 10 seconds. Used in phase 2 only

'''Molten Punch''': Anyone within 40 yards of him during phase 2 will get a huge damage knockback for 5k. Used in phase 2 only

'''Hateful Strike''': Hateful. Not hurtful. A SINGLE attack on the HIGHEST HP TARGET IN MELEE RANGE. Thought to have some relation to threat as well. Hits for upwards of 20k on cloth. Hits bears for 7-8k. Different in execution, very similar in action plan for gruul. best bet here is a feral in bear gear soaking hateful strikes. Used in phase 1 only

==Strategy==

I apologize for this in advance, but it is ridiculously simple.

Phase 1
- Standard tank and spank. Ranged spread out around supremus. Melee behind him. 
- 99% of damage will be on the MT and OT. The OT needs to be better geared, at least in the HP department, to survive hatefuls. 
- Get out of the fire. 
- Aggro is reset between phase 1 and 2.

Phase 2
- Kiting phase. EVERYONE in melee is strongly encouraged to maintain at least a 30 yard range from him during this. In theory it is possible to run in after he changes targets, DPS for 5 seconds, then run out. Due to gaze and near insta gibs on target changes, and the fact that for phase 1 melee will stand there and simply wreck him - i highly encourage melee to just stand around with their hands in their pockets for this phase.
- Aggro is a non issue in this phase. It is reset between phase 2 and 1 however, so watch your dots (1 to 2 is not an issue, 2 to 1 is)


==Hit list of questions==
- 1 or 2 OTs? 1 seems ideal, 2 seems 'safe'. I'd hate to limit the DPS options of our tanks, but it's something we need to decide on nonetheless.
- Is supremus tauntable?
- Is there any more to this fight other than 'GET OUT OF THE FIRE'?
- How long is the enrage timer?

All in all, this seems like a simple fight that comes down to two key points:

1. Keep your tanks up. Solution: 90% of heals focused on tanks.
2. Stay alive. Get out of the fire, don't get into melee range on phase 2.
