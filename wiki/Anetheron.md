==The Concept==
Think Black Morass. The boss 'event' is a 9 wave round of timed spawns. 8 waves of 'trash', and then a 9th and final boss wave with Rage Winterchill himself. The pacing is exact to BM. Rough spawn timers suggest that trash waves come 2 minutes after the previous wave, and the 9th boss wave comes 3 minutes after the previous wave.

Rogues can (chain) distract approaching bosses in order to provide a few more seconds of OOC time for boss prep.

You will leave combat the second you kill the previous trash wave. Again, mechanics are identical to black morass. If you don't feel comfortable with this sort of pacing, do us all a favour and run Heroic BM, or timed ZA runs.



==The Trash==
All trash can be CCed using appropriate class CCs (Shackle, Trap, Sheep, Fear). This is largely 'AOE trash.'

Features 5 unique types
*'''Ghouls''': 140k HP. Cannibalizes at low health (7%hp/tick heal). Low Melee hits (1-1.5k).
*'''Abominations''': 180k HP. Random stun. High Melee hits (3k). Poison Cloud Aura (750/tick).
*'''Necromancers''': 120k HP. Shadowbolt (2500ish damage). Cripple. Summon Skeletons**. Casts Unholy Frenzy*
**Unholy Frenzy - Increases an ally's attack speed by 100% for 20 sec, but also inflicts 500 nature damage to that ally every 2 sec. Can be stacked for some insane rogue single target DPS on harder trash (shouldn't be needed on rage). Needs to be dispelled otherwise.
**Summon Skeletons - Insignificant. Summons random 30k health skeletons that will be caught in the AOE.
*'''Crypt Fiends''': 170k HP. Medium Melee hits (2k). Web (Undispellable 10 second root).
*'''Banshee''': HP unknown. Banshee Curse (MUST BE DISPELLED FROM MELEE), Banshee Wail (Shadow Bolt) and Anti-Magic Shell

*Wave 1 10 Ghouls

*Wave 8 3 Ghouls, 3 Crypt Fiends, 4 Abominations, 2 Necromancers, 2 Banshees

==Strategy==
The almost universal method/suggested strategy for clearing Hyjal trash is the frequent and repetitive abuse of prot paladins to AOE tank and DPS the majority of the trash. 

Tanking Assingments:
- Prot paladin(s) tanking as many Ghouls, Crypt Fiends as possible
- Ferals and Warriors tanking as many of the Abominations as possible
- Sheep as many Necromancers as possible / needed
- Shackle any leftover abominations

The obvious and intended goal is to blow away the large amount of crypt fiends/ghouls while avoiding the more dangerous targets. Key points I've found here is ensuring that your paladin tank who is on the mass of mobs does NOT have abomination aggro as a stun on the paladin while the other mobs beat on him means certain death due to lack of avoidance.

One key point on shadowy necromancer pulls, they will unleash a SB volley at the first target they see. Prot warriors up front during the pull while CC gets established. Spell reflect anything launched at you to provide a nice buffer (4 SBs coming at some poor mage is something yo uwant to avoid, obviously...)

Other than that, everything stated indicates a very clear cut and simple tank and spank type scenario.

==Kiting==
I can't really put this any clearer than a simple picture does. In short, a single hunter will be used to pull a single mob into the alliance NPC camps. Once the mob aggros the NPCs they will assist in the battle. They do horrendous damage but have a large life pool and will ease in the tanking/dps assignments required.


==DPS Order==
The priority targets in terms of raid danger are Necros > Abominations > Ghouls > Fiends. As such this also makes for an excellent initial kill target order. This is meant for single target DPS. AOE will be...AOEing, and attempting to address the 2nd biggest danger, which is a lack of enough raid DPS to exit combat fast enough and regen for the Nth rounds.



Few initial points to rag on:
- We might be better served using a paladin tank IF possible for aggro issues
- Our obvious sticking point is infernal control. Aside from MDs we need to be more proactive in assisting the infernal tank
- IF YOU GET THE INFERNAL TARGET, RUN TO THE TANK. I saw a few people being targetted and not doing this.
- More of an observation tha na problem. Nite (our MT) got targetted a few times, and since he can't really move effectively, we need some form of strategy to deal with this. The only thing I can think of is MDs, potentially saving an MD for this case, but that means better execution on all the others so I'm not sure if that's a good idea.




==Boss Strat==

- Separate your healers into 3 camps so that only 1/3 of the healing is gimped at any one time.
- Assign MD rotations to the Infernal tank so that he does not have far too go. If you cannot use MD for an Infernal, it becomes the job of the Infernal's target to know they are being targeted and run toward the tank so that they might pick it up off you and take minimal damage. Infernal control is the fight, basically. Anetheron does not hit hard, and controlling loose Infernals is vital. It is very easy to be 1 shotted by an Infernal impact + Fire Aura pulse + Carrion Swarm. If you have DBM or BigWigs, it will announce who is the Infernal's target. If fast, a Priest can PW:Shield that target to prevent an instagib.
- Infernal tank should stay at the back, near Jaina, as she will help burn down the Infernal. Infernal Tank healers should be behind her, as to avoid being struck by Carrion Swarm. IIRC, you can range it, so your Infernal tank will be getting heals at maximum capacity.
- I believe we ran 8 healers, with 2 tanks, 1 normal, 1 FR. 3 camps of 2 healers, and 2 in the back for Infernal tanking. Try to avoid casters getting behind Anetheron, as them being targeted by an Infernal will almost certainly kill people. The closer DPS is to Jaina in a cone shape, the less distance there is between yourselves and the Infernal tank.
- When the Infernal is in tanking position, set and ready, ALLLLLLLLLLL ranged DPS switches and kills it ASAP. 2 Infernals up = wipe. The majority of your Anetheron DPS is done by melee. We use a Paladin tank for Infernals, as they have the best burst initial threat capacity. If not a Paladin, a Druid or Warrior is fine.

The fight, in a nutshell: Control Infernals, deal with Carrion Swarm, DPS. Sleep can be annoying, and if one of the MT healers gets slept, call it out on Ventrillo/TS so another healer can shift over and resume heals. Restoration Shaman are insane for this fight, as are Circle of Healing Priests. Stay tight with your group, so AoE heals can do their magic.

I'm not sure how you guys did, but you definitely understand the basics of the fight. As for SR, its good, but not as crucial, as opposed to Azgalor and his Raidwide Silence. Definitely work on SR and in the long run, you will be glad you did.
