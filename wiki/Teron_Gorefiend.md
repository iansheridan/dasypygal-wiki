==Strategy==

While Teron has a relatively low amount of health, this is a DPS race because his Shadow of Death debuff will kill raid members and you will have either less healers or DPS as the fight progresses. 

Only one tank is needed. A well-geared warrior or paladin tank is recommended to deal with the powerful crushing blows. Other tanks in the raid should switch to DPS or healing gear. 

It is imperative that your melee DPS stand behind Teron so that he does not parry and attack your tank faster. There is a good amount of raid damage occurring throughout the entire fight and does progressively increase as the fight goes on. 2-3 Healers should be assigned to raid healing and 

2-3 should be assigned as solid tank healers. The rest should focus on either the tank or the raid, whichever seems to need it. 

All buff consumables should be used, the more DPS your raid outputs the better in shape you are for the fight. Prayer of Shadow Protection is a necessity. Soulstones should be ready to be used for the various healer that gets the Shadow of Death. 

Incinerate (the dot that Teron randomly applies) needs to be dispelled as soon as possible. The incinerate will do massive amounts of damage and if placed on the wrong person can cause death (which coupled with the Shadow of Death can result in an almost guaranteed wipe). 

Upon pulling, your healers should get in position at their leisure, keeping your main tank up is more important that positions (initially, anyways). As said before, your melee should get behind Teron and remain there, while the rest of your raid should hang out on the platform where Teron initially is. Pop Heroism/Bloodlust as soon as your tank has solid threat, hopefully before your first Shadow of Death. 

Shadow of Death is cast every 30 seconds, and lasts 55 seconds. Healers that get this should be soulstoned, with the exception of shamans (if their ankh is up). Upon expiration of the debuff OR death, the target will "die" and become a vengeful spirit. See Ghost Form strategy for more. 

==Ghost Form strategy==
Before the Shadow of Death debuff fades (at about 15-20 sec left), run to the south end of the room and wait for the constructs to spawn. The ghost skills will appear in place of your main action bar so you can use 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7. After you turn into a ghost, use Spirit Volley (5) followed immediately by Spirit Chains (4) which will AoE attack and shackle the constructs, giving you time to setup the lances. 

Begin start tab cycling the constructs and cast Spirit Lance (3) on each of them, starting with the ones closest to the raid. Spirit Lances will stack and slow them with each debuff, but they have a short duration, so be sure to evenly distribute attacks to each one to prevent the possibility of one or two getting away from you. Keep lancing (3) until your AoE abilities reset their cooldown, then just use them both again in the same sequence, Spirit Volley (5) followed by Spirit Chains (4), and they should all be dead with 2-3 more lances. 

Once your constructs are dead, provide a healer in your group with Spirit Shield (7) and get within melee range of Teron and attack him with Spirit Strike (1). You can also assist others with lancing (3) their constructs.
