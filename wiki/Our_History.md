Before King Magni Bronzebeard decreed that Prospectors should go forth and search for the Titans’ hidden legacies. A group of friends had been “Prospecting” on their own for years. This group of friends called themselves the “Dasypygal Gentlemen”. The leader of this group was one Dagar Bottomsworth.

Surprisingly the founding members were a ragtag group of miners. Here is the story that started it all:

One day Dagar (the first) found a chamber while digging the vein his father passed on to him. He and the few friends that he could convince to help him in the mine have been digging this vein with little to no results and they were close to closing the mine. Upon entering the newly found chamber Dagar discovered it filled with strange slabs of a rock not found in the mountain range the mine was in. These slabs where covered in strange writing. Dagar yelled for the others and excitement sparked and rushed though everyone in the mine. A runner was sent to inform the local scholar.

While the runner, a young Dager the II, ran off the group of friends gathered and decided that this was an opportunity not to be squandered. They came to the conclusion that they would first sell the slabs to the scholar and then continue the search for other chambers such as this.

The scholar came, word spread and wealth rained down on the founding members. All of whom are now dedicated to finding more of the Titans’ hidden legacies.

This created the motto of the guild: “Search Ye Out That Which Was Once Titan”


Resent History:
Dagar the II grew up not as a miner as his father had but as a gentlemen scholar in search of that which was once Titan. The same could of been said of Dagar the III yet his calling was not that which pulled his father and grandfather. The holy work of a Paladin called him. This estranged him from his father and grandfather. His brother Ganggi, on the other hand, did have the spark for the “search”.

Talk of a strange rock in a far off mountain range reached Dagar’s father’s ear. This lit a blaze in the Guild. They all including his brother, packed up and practically flew out of Ironforge.

Weeks, months and then a year passed and no word. Dagar came to the end of his training as a Paladin and is now restarting the guild of Dasypygal Gentlemen to search out not only “That Which Was Once Titan” but also his family.
