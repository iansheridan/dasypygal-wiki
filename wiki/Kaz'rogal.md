==Strategy==

Get all your dps out on the channeler and the sorcerers (shadow priests and affliction warlocks place their DOTs on all of them) so that phase 2 begins and finish it off. Tank all adds that spawn directly at the spawnpoint, except for the vindicators, they are tanked near akama because they directly run to him. 

When Phase 2 begins, kill the Shade of Akama before he kills Akama. The Shade deals 10 times more damage than Akama but has the same Health points. Akama himself hits him for ~2000 mainhand and ~1000 offhand and he applies an infinitive stacking poison on the shade that produces 5% more damage per stack.




== The Fight ==

The fight is initiated by talking to Akama.

The first wave of adds will spawn a few seconds after the fight begins.

Melee in your Channeler team focuses on each Channeler at a time while the warlock constantly keeps DoTs on each of the Channelers.

When the sets of three mobs spawn, they'll be sprinting for the centre of the room. A hunter should have preemptively set a Frost Trap. As soon as the three mobs are targetable, the mage should Frost Nova them in place and back up. S/he can then Polymorph the Ashtongue Rogue, and the 3 DPS will kill the Ashtongue Spiritbinder, then the Ashtongue Elementalist, and then the Ashtongue Rogue.

The fight will seem very difficult until the frost nova trick is used to root these packs of 3 Ashtongue in place long enough for a tank to generate threat. The Frost Trap that hunters lie just adds redundancy to the tactic. Mages who position themselves poorly can get killed if they don't move too quickly away from the Frost Nova-ed mobs.

A group of 1 Ashtongue Rogue, 1 Ashtongue Elementalist and 1 Ashtongue Spiritbinder will spawn approximately every 35 seconds from both doors. Also, an Ashtongue Guardian will spawn from the right door every 15 seconds, and go straight for Akama. Until they reach Akama, the Guardians will not respond to attempts to aggro them, but they can be aggroed normally after that. The third tank, preferably a druid, is assigned to tanking them.

The first in the kill priority are the Spiritbinders and Elementalists as they heal the most and do the most damage, and they have the least health.

Second for the kill are the Rogues, while the Guardians must remain offtanked for the duration of the fight.

About the time the Channelers are dead, about 5-6 Guardians minimum should be on the third tank, which means he'll require significant healing.

In addition to the normal adds, Ashtongue Sorcerers will also spawn sometimes, who will run up to the Shade, ignoring all aggro and help with Banishing the Shade. They have to be killed like the Channelers by the Channeler team.

If all goes well, after about 3-4 minutes all Channelers and Sorcerers should be dead and the Shade of Akama will break free and attack Akama. Akama will in turn attack it as well, and tank it for the fight, applying a poison debuff on Shade of Akama that increases the damage taken by 5% and is stackable. You cannot pull aggro from Akama.

When Shade of Akama is free, you can quickly finish off your target, if it's at like 10-20%, but very quickly you need all raid DPS on Shade of Akama. If you have too many adds up, just chain Polymorph and fear them or have them tanked for the remainder of the fight.

You have to save all cooldowns: Berzerking, Blade Flurry, Recklessness etc for killing the Shade. The Shade of Akama does a lot more damage than Akama himself, and it will kill him in about a minute maximum. You must kill the Shade of Akama before Akama dies, or you will lose and the encounter will reset. When the Shade of Akama dies, all the adds will soon despawn.


== Class Assignments ==

'''Tanks''' - Make sure to grab aggro on the adds as they come out. Hamstring and Piercing Howl would help if they try running. Druids might try Bashing them to stop them. You might need to run back after them to grab them, but once you do, bring them back to your tank spot.

'''Melee DPS''' - Your job is to kill the Channelers and incoming Sorcerers. They will ignore all aggro and will never stop Banishing the Shade, so feel free to deal as much damage as you like.

'''Warlocks''' - Your job is to keep DoTs up on the Channelers at all times, or to help control the packs of 3 adds.

'''Hunters''' - You'll be in the Adds Teams. Make sure you put in a Freezing(slowing) trap at the entrances so that the mobs don't rush in uncontrolled.

'''Mages''' - You'll be in the Adds Teams. Your priority is to learn to use Frost Nova effectively on these groups. DPS and don't overaggro. Use Fire Shield to prevent some unlucky Rain of Fire damage.

'''Healers''' - You need 1 healer on each of the tanks, with 2-3 healers on the Ashtongue Guardian tank as the fight progresses. The rest of the healers, preferably shamans, should focus on raid healing.
