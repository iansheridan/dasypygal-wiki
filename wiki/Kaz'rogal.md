==The Concept==
Think Black Morass. The boss 'event' is a 9 wave round of timed spawns. 8 waves of 'trash', and then a 9th and final boss wave with Rage Winterchill himself. The pacing is exact to BM. Rough spawn timers suggest that trash waves come 2 minutes after the previous wave, and the 9th boss wave comes 3 minutes after the previous wave.

Rogues can (chain) distract approaching bosses in order to provide a few more seconds of OOC time for boss prep.

You will leave combat the second you kill the previous trash wave. Again, mechanics are identical to black morass. If you don't feel comfortable with this sort of pacing, do us all a favour and run Heroic BM, or timed ZA runs.



==The Trash==
All trash can be CCed using appropriate class CCs (Shackle, Trap, Sheep, Fear). This is largely 'AOE trash.'

Features 7 unique types
*'''Ghouls''': 140k HP. Cannibalizes at low health (7%hp/tick heal). Low Melee hits (1-1.5k).
*'''Abominations''': 180k HP. Random stun. High Melee hits (3k). Poison Cloud Aura (750/tick).
*'''Necromancers''': 120k HP. Shadowbolt (2500ish damage). Cripple. Summon Skeletons**. Casts Unholy Frenzy*
**Unholy Frenzy - Increases an ally's attack speed by 100% for 20 sec, but also inflicts 500 nature damage to that ally every 2 sec. Can be stacked for some insane rogue single target DPS on harder trash (shouldn't be needed on rage). Needs to be dispelled otherwise.
**Summon Skeletons - Insignificant. Summons random 30k health skeletons that will be caught in the AOE.
*'''Crypt Fiends''': 170k HP. Medium Melee hits (2k). Web (Undispellable 10 second root).
*'''Banshee''': HP unknown. Banshee Curse (MUST BE DISPELLED FROM MELEE), Banshee Wail (Shadow Bolt) and Anti-Magic Shell
*'''Gargoyle''': HP unknown.  Low Melee Hit (1K) and Cast Gargoyle Strike.  Move around to get them close to the ground.
*'''Frost Wyrm''': HP unknown.  Cast Frost Breath - 35yd attack dealing 2.5-3.5 Frost Damage and splash damage over 18 yds.  Must be ranged down.

==Strategy==
The almost universal method/suggested strategy for clearing Hyjal trash is the frequent and repetitive abuse of prot paladins to AOE tank and DPS the majority of the trash. 

Tanking Assingments:
- Prot paladin(s) tanking as many Ghouls, Crypt Fiends as possible
- Ferals and Warriors tanking as many of the Abominations as possible
- Lock/hunter tanking the Frost Wyrm and Gathering Gargoyles
- Sheep as many Necromancers as possible / needed
- Shackle any leftover abominations

The obvious and intended goal is to blow away the large amount of crypt fiends/ghouls while avoiding the more dangerous targets. Key points I've found here is ensuring that your paladin tank who is on the mass of mobs does NOT have abomination aggro as a stun on the paladin while the other mobs beat on him means certain death due to lack of avoidance.

One key point on shadowy necromancer pulls, they will unleash a SB volley at the first target they see. Prot warriors up front during the pull while CC gets established. Spell reflect anything launched at you to provide a nice buffer (4 SBs coming at some poor mage is something yo uwant to avoid, obviously...)

Other than that, everything stated indicates a very clear cut and simple tank and spank type scenario.

==Kiting==
I can't really put this any clearer than a simple picture does. In short, a single hunter will be used to pull a single mob into the alliance NPC camps. Once the mob aggros the NPCs they will assist in the battle. They do horrendous damage but have a large life pool and will ease in the tanking/dps assignments required.


==DPS Order==
The priority targets in terms of raid danger are Necros > Abominations > Ghouls > Fiends > Gargoyles. As such this also makes for an excellent initial kill target order. This is meant for single target DPS. AOE will be...AOEing, and attempting to address the 2nd biggest danger, which is a lack of enough raid DPS to exit combat fast enough and regen for the Nth rounds.

Always DoT Frost Wyrms until it's their turn to die.


==Boss Abilities==
Melee: 2-3k on plate
Cleave: 10-12k to all melee in a frontal arc 
War Stomp: 15 yard AoE, 1700-2500 damage plus 5 sec stun 
Mark of Kaz'rogal: A debuff inflicted on all mana users in the raid. Drains 600 mana per second for 5 sec. If mana is reduced to zero by the debuff, the target detonates for 10.213 to 11.287 AoE damage. Resistable but not Dispellable. 
[edit] Raid setup and equipment 
The raid composition is mainly determined by what works best on the eight waves of trash mobs preceeding the boss. On the boss himself, about any mix of damage dealers and healers will do. Kaz'rogals hit box is just large enough that it's possible to melee him from outside the range of his warstomp. As ususal, melee should set up behind him to avoid the cleave. Ranged damage dealers and healers should stand well distributed in a wide circle so that one exploding player doesn't hurt others. 

All mana users should have about 150 Shadow resistance buffed, because the Mark of Kaz'rogal and all of its effects can be resisted. The [Medallion of Karabor] and one more crafted item (see the Shadow resistance article for details) should suffice, it's not a good idea to nerf oneself too much. The fight is primarily a DPS race, not a battle for survival. 

==Horde NPCs==
If Thrall and his NPCs, particularly the tauren warriors, are all up they can do about 15% damage on their own. This can be very important near the end of the fight - there are many reports of Kaz'rogal kills with only one surviving raid member watching while the NPCs brought down the last 7% or so. 

In order to speed up things it's possible to have the MT kite Kaz'rogal through the two groups of NPCs, but it's just as feasible to wait until they enter the fight by themselves (which they usually do in any case). Kiting is somewhat detrimental to raid DPS, so it should be done only if the NPCs do more damage by their early entry than is lost due to aggro problems by the raid. 

==Mana management==
Mana users need to try anything they can to keep their mana up. Blessing of Wisdom, Flask of Mighty Restoration and Blackened Sporefish as well as Superior Mana Oil should all be in effect. Super Mana Potions should be used on every cooldown, starting as early as possible. Shadowfiends, Evocation, Mana Tide Totem, Innervate, etc must all not be on cooldown. Mages may use Ice Block and Paladins may use Divine Shield before (or immediately after) being afflicted by Kaz'rogal's Mark, thus avoiding one completely. Heroism/Bloodlust can be used early (but not too early, watch aggro) so that the high mana cost can be recovered before the first mark, or can be used late, when death is inevitable anyways. Innervates should best be used on Shadow Priest(s). When a mana user runs low, it's a good idea to burn the last mana quickly, and then move to a safe spot, not to harm others. 

'''==Battle rezzes==''' (Soulstone, Ankh etc.) are only of limited usefulness because raid members are rezzed without buffs and less than a full mana bar, therefore they usually die again on the next Mark. Nontheless, if used right after a Mark, a rez can mean one-half mana bar of nukes (or heals on the melee group), which can make the difference in a tight fight.

==Enrage== 
The first Mark of Kaz'rogal is cast after 60 seconds. The time until the next Mark is cast is reduced by 10 seconds each time, so that the 2nd mark happens at 1:50, the 3rd at 2:30 and so on. In the end, it's cast continually (every 5 seconds that is). This works in effect like a soft enrage, after about four minutes mana users will inevitably start to die. After some time all healers are dead, the last surviving raid members are usually rogues or DPS warriors, who must stay out of melee range and hope the NPCs bring the boss down. Warlocks with a sacrificed Felhunter also can stay alive very long (spamming Drain Life and Life Tap).
