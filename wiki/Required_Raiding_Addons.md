==Threat Meters==

Threat Meters are an invaluable tool for many encounters. They help to let tanks and dps (and healers even) visualize a boss's aggro. There are many threat meter addons but we're especially partial to [http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/omen-threat-meter.aspx Omen] since like many other [http://wowace.com/ wowace addons] it is very lightweight on your system requirements and doesn't tax your computer's memory.

==Debuff Removal==
If you're a class that can remove disease, magic, curses or poisons we suggest using Decursive. If you have an addon that preforms a similar function that you prefer continue to use it and let us know what it is so we can get post it in the wiki for others. 

'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/decursive.aspx Decursive]'''

This is a cleaning mod. Its job is to help a class that can remove afflictions to do it with ease in every conditions (playing solo, in small groups or in big raids).



==Healer Unit Frames==
All Healers are required to have a good raiding unit frame addon, the standard blizzard raid frames fail to convey the information that is needed in many raiding environments.



'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/grid.aspx Grid]'''

Grid is a modular, lightweight and screen-estate saving grid of party/raid unit frames based on Ace2 and various embedded libraries provided by the Ace-community.

Due to its flexible design, Grid has a fairly daunting configuration menu. I suggest taking a few minutes to look through the configuration and familiarize yourself with the options available to you.


If you don't like Grid you can try:


'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/heal-bot-continued.aspx HealBot]'''

Healbot is a party interface that is optimized for healing and has buttons to cast spells on each person in the party. Healbot will never autocast.



'''[http://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/info4673.html PerfectRaid]'''

PerfectRaid is a whole new look on raid frames, giving you as much information as possible in an easily recognizable format that's easy to place. Show as much or as little as you're interested in, and completely customize using the each options editor.



'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/vuhdo.aspx Vuhdo]'''

What is VuhDo? â€“ VuhDo is a raid monitor similar to CTRaidAssist or Blizzards built-in raid frames. Basically this is about displaying the health of raid members in form of clearly arranged bars. VuhDo is primarily directed to healing classes, but will make use to almost any other class. Moreover several healing spells or other actions can be asserted to mouse clicks on those bars (Click-Heal).

Clique is a simple GUI that lets you assign click-casting for any number of unit frames. Click casting allows you to define the behavior the game takes when you click on a frame.

'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/quartz.aspx Quartz]'''

Quartz is a cast bar replacement. The biggest thing that I find useful about it is the latency display. this is what the nice people at ace have to say about Quartz and the Latency Display:

Displays the amount of time spent between cast send and start events, in the form of a bar at the end of your casting bar, with optional text that displays the actual duration of the lag. This helps in canceling casts when they will not actually be interrupted, especially for users with consistently high pings.


'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/omni-cc.aspx Omni CC]'''

OmniCC is an addon that adds text to items/spells/abilities that are on cooldown to indicate when they'll be ready for use once again. OmniCC should be compatible with anything that uses standard cooldown functions.


'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/powerauras-classic.aspx Power Auras]'''

This addon was created to provide visual cues (auras) when you gain buffs, debuffs and many more. Very useful for shorts buffs or debuffs, it allows you to draw in the center of the screen, or around your character, very customizable visual effects, rather than having to look at or mouseover buff/debuff icons/actionbars.
