==Abilities==
Normal Form: 

Melee: Illidan melees from 6k to 8k on plate. He doesn't crush (so avoiding Shear is most important) 
Shear: Reduces the health of his current main aggro target by 60% for 7 seconds. Shear has a 1.5 second cast time, so the main tank must be ready to use Shield Block (which mitigates the attack). 
Flame Crash: Illidan jumps up high and lands in a patch of blue flames directly underneath his current position. The flames deal 5k fire damage per second. 10 yard radius. They remain on the ground for 2 minutes. 1.3 sec cast. 
Draw Soul: Illidan will drain targets in front of him in a similar way to Cone of Cold, dealing 5k shadow damage and healing Illidan for 100,000 HP. Shadow based spell. Resistible. 
Parasitic Shadowfiend: Random raid members will be targeted with a Parasites debuff lasting 10 seconds and dealing 3k shadow damage every 2 seconds. Once this debuff has ticked off, 2 Parasites will spawn at the affected player's location and attempt to melee whoever is highest on global threat (generally a healer). If they are successful in this melee attack, the targeted raid member will receive the Parasitic Shadowfiend debuff. Parasites have around 6k HP. 
Agonizing Flames: Illidan will randomly target a player and cast this, dealing 4000 initial fire damage to the target and anyone within 5 yards, and giving them a debuff which causes fire 3k damage every 5 seconds for 1 minute. He will only use this ability in night elf form in phase 3. 
Enrage: Increases damage and attack speed after a time during phase 5. 
Demon Form: 

 
Illidan in Demon FormShadow Blast: Illidan will Shadow Blast the target highest on threat for between 8k and 11k shadow damage. This Shadow Blast has a splash effect - raid members within 20 yards of the affected target will receive the damage from the spell. Resistible. 
Flame Burst: Illidan throws fire upon the entire raid for around 3.5k damage every 10 seconds. Players within 5 yards of each other will receive splash damage from this ability. Resistible. 
Shadow Demons: During this phase Illidan will spawn 4 Shadow Demons at his feet that target random raid members and paralyze (stun) them. The demons will then slowly move towards the players in question; if they reach one of the players then he/she will die and the demon will target somebody else. The demons have around 22k HP. 
Aura of Dread: A 15 yard aura surrounds Illidan dealing 1000 shadow damage every second to raid members within 15 yards of him, and also increasing Shadow Damage taken by 30%. This effect stacks over time. 
Flying in air: 

Fireball: casting time 2 sec, Deal fire damage 2550-3450 in 10 yards radius. 
Eye Blast: Illidan will sweep a fiery blue beam, emanating from his eyes, across the platform every 30 seconds. This deals around 19750-20250 fire damage on initial hit and spawns Demon Fire on the ground for 1 minute. 
Demon fire: This is the blue fire trail left on ground by Eye Blast. It deals 2000 fire damage per second if you stand in it. 
Dark Barrage: Illidan randomly chooses a player and places a dark eye beam on him, which deals 3000 shadow damage per second for 10 seconds. 
Flames of Azzinoth: 

Health: around 1 million 
Melee: They hit for around 2-3k fire damage on a 365 fire resistance tank if you get a 75% resist check. Their base hit is roughly 15k fire damage. They can crit, but they do not crush. 
Blaze: The Flames will leave a cloud of yellow flame underneath them on the ground, which deals 5000 fire damage per second. Two different Blazes in the same location DO stack. 
Flame Blast: Frontal cone 15 yard AoE which deals 7000-9000 fire damage. 
Enrage/Charge: Each blade on the ground has an invisible aura with 25 yard range that grants immunity to charge from *both* elementals (i.e. you only need to be under of affect of one of the auras), if anyone steps outside this aura or an elemental gets further than 25 yards from its own blade they will charge/enrage and wipe the raid. 
Encounter Enrage Timer: 

Berserk (Hard Enrage): - After 25 minutes Illidan will go berserk, 500% damage increase and 150% attack speed, killing the entire raid in VERY short order.

Each blade will spawn a Flame of Azzinoth, a powerful fire elemental with over 1 million hit points. The second stage ends when both Flame of Azzinoth are dead. Move away from the inner circle and prepare for stage 3.

Summon Shadow Demons: Summons 4 Shadow Demons to aid the caster. These demons cast Paralyze on a random target and move towards them slowly, ignoring everyone else.

Stage 4 75 sec. after the death of the second Shard of Azzinoth which ended the second stage Illidan turns into his Demon Form and begin Stage 4. At Stage 4 Illidan will wipe his threat meter. 

Stage 5 As Illidan reaches 30% health, Maiev Shadowsong enters the battle. She periodically blinks to a player in the raid and places down a trap that can be used against Illidan. In this stage, Illidan enters an enraged state which significantly increases his damage to the point of being unhealable. The tank needs to drag Illidan towards the trap, click to activate it, and position Illidan on top of it. While trapped, Illidan takes additional damage from every player attacking him. Keep attacking him until hes hit points reaches zero.
