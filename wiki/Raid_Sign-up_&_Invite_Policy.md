==Raid Sign-up==
All members who wish to raid must use the [http://dasypygal.dyndns.org/raid/ raid sign-up calendar]. Using the calendar lets us see who is available and what the raid composition will look like at invite time, it allows the raid leaders to know what spots we may be lacking and where we may have an excess. As always please indicate in your sign-up note if you will be late.

==How will invite priority be handled for raids?==
Invite priority for all raids (10-man and 25-man) will be as follows:

#GM/Council Officers (Only those classified as Core raiders)
#Junior Officers
#Core Raiders
#Casual Raiders (including council officers classified as Casual)
#Probies
#Non-Raiders
#Alts

In all cases you must be logged on with your main at the time of invites. If you are logged as an alt, you will be skipped over. And remember, class balance trumps all invite priority.
