==Membership Requests==
Greetings gentlemen,

Thank you for showing enough interest to even come this far. It is not hard to become a member but it calls for at least a little creativity.


'''How to Join Dasypygal Gentlemen?'''

*We ask that you join our forum with your character name. [http://dasypygal.dyndns.org/forums/ucp.php?mode=register  Click here to register] 

*Once you have registered please contact an [http://dasypygal.dyndns.org/wiki/index.php/Officers  officer of the guild] in game so that we can appove your account on the forums. We had to do this to stop spammers from posting to the forums.

*You can then post to the [http://dasypygal.dyndns.org/forums/viewforum.php?f=2  Hair Club for Probies forum] using the application form [http://dasypygal.dyndns.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=11 posted here]. Please use that section to introduce yourself to our other members and register for membership. 

*You must have a current member (one ranked as a “respected gentleman” or greater see [http://dasypygal.dyndns.org/roster/  member list]) sponsor you. Because of this, you will most likely group with a member. If the DG member you are grouping with cannot sponsor don’t worry he/she will talk to one that can.


''Again, please make sure that you register on the forums with your character name and tell us when you will be online so that we can meet and group.'' 


We look for involvement in the guild. We are very tolerant but we are looking for people to join our community so your participation is highly valued by all the officers of the guild. In joining us in playing this game we join you in playing this game.


You will start out as a Probie. To get full membership, after you fufill the requirements above, the officers will talk about your involement in guild activities and participation in the Forums. Once we agree that you have fufilled these requirements full membership is yours. Don’t worry you don’t have to go crazy just we don’t look for a tremendous amount of visibility.

I also ask that you take a look at our About Guild page and the Guild History page to get familiar with what we are about.
