## TeamSpeak Etiquette

Please be aware that children can be on at any time. Watch your language and be respectful of everyone else. Know when it's ok to be social and when you need to keep TS clear. Move into separate channels when it makes sense to do that. When you join a new channel be sure to announce your presence when you get the opportunity (Don't be interuptive!)
