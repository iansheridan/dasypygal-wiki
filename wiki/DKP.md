# DKP

## Introduction
All policies should promote raid progression. What's the best way to achieve raid progression? Our raiders need 3 things:
1. To be there
2. To learn the encounters (trash and bosses alike)
3. Have the right gear

We used to have a very unique homebrew loot system. Like any other loot system it had it's pros and cons. Over the course of the last year of live-testing the officership came to the determination that we had outgrown our old model.

## Why the change?
We wanted the system to provide more incentive for being a good raider.
You should get extra points for stuff like being on-time, staying for the whole raid, etc. The more you raid, the better your chance to get items that will be of future use to the raid.

## We wanted to put the players in control.
Our new system allows users to bid on multiple items during a single session and also gives a granular level of control over their own points. If that item doesn't mean so much to you then just meet the minimum, if it means a lot then bid more. Hopefully over time this will also encourage people to take more situational or marginally useful items for experimentation as well. 

## We wanted it to be simple and familiar.
The essence of the system should be explainable in a couple sentences. There can still be provisions for various atypical cases and more detailed clarifications, but the system itself should not require pages of reading to understand. A lot of raiders know dkp. It also shows a clear cultural shift that we're a raiding first guild now.

## We wanted it to be scalable.
Specifically, if the system values different items at different costs, it should use a steady constant -- for example item level -- instead of an arbitrary chart created for each particular instance. This way, whenever new loot or instances are introduced, there is no need to update anything or make new determinations as to what things are worth.

## We want it to be fast.
It should be quick in real-time execution. One of the biggest causes for slowdown in a raid is loot. Determining who is awarded loot should be handled quickly and efficiently.

## Awarding
One-time only seed bonus = 400 pts

Boss Learning = 10 pts

First Time Boss Kill = 30 pts

Boss Kill = 15 pts

Raid Cancellation = 15pts

## A few caveats:
Only players in the guild prior to Cataclysm can receive the seed bonus. Think of it as a reward for sticking with us over the years. 


The seed bonus will no longer be applied after 3/1/2011. Think of it as a reward for busting your hump to be a valued raider early in our Cataclysm progression.


We're also implementing a decay system this time out. If you're inactive for 2 months of raiding then your DKP is cut in 1/2 and after 4 months of raiding inactivity your DKP is reduced to 0.

## Costs
Main spec need costs are 150 dkp minimum bid. 
This is what you use if you want something for your main spec.


Main spec take costs are 150 dkp minimum bid. 
This is what you use if you want something for your main spec but would prefer it to go to someone else (it might be a bigger upgrade for them)


Off spec greed costs are 30 dkp minimum bid. 
This is what you use if you want something for your secondary spec or don't have enough points to bid on it for primary spec.

## Bid Process

UPDATE: This is the addon we use to bid on items in a raid. It is required for all raiders.
