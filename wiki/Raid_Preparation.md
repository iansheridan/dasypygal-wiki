==Threat Meters==

Threat Meters are an invaluable tool for many encounters. They help to let tanks and dps (and healers even) visualize a boss's aggro. There are many threat meter addons but we're especially partial to [http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/omen-threat-meter.aspx Omen] since like many other [http://wowace.com/ wowace addons] it is very lightweight on your system requirements and doesn't tax your computer's memory.

==Debuff Removal==
If you're a class that can remove disease, magic, curses or poisons we suggest using Decursive. If you have an addon that preforms a similar function that you prefer continue to use it and let us know what it is so we can get post it in the wiki for others.

==Healer Unit Frames==
All Healers are required to have a good raiding unit frame addon, the standard blizzard raid frames fail to convey the information that is needed in many raiding environments.


'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/grid.aspx Grid]''' ''(recommended)''

Grid is a modular, lightweight and screen-estate saving grid of party/raid unit frames based on Ace2 and various embedded libraries provided by the Ace-community.

Due to its flexible design, Grid has a fairly daunting configuration menu. I suggest taking a few minutes to look through the configuration and familiarize yourself with the options available to you.


If you don't like Grid you can try:


'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/sraidframes.aspx SRaidFrames]'''

sRaidFrames was designed to replace the raid frames provided by CT_RaidAssist. They share the same look and feel of the original frames, but are highly optimised and even include extra features such as aggro highlighting and display of PVE critical abilities.


'''[http://wow.curse.com/downloads/wow-addons/details/xperl.aspx Xperl]'''

Perl, with Extra stuff. Much enchanced from Nymbia's Perl UnitFrames, and a complete replacement for Blizzard's default unit frames, including raid frames and raid tools, with little remaining of the original Nymbia code.
