==The Concept==
Think Black Morass. The boss 'event' is a 9 wave round of timed spawns. 8 waves of 'trash', and then a 9th and final boss wave with Rage Winterchill himself. The pacing is exact to BM. Rough spawn timers suggest that trash waves come 2 minutes after the previous wave, and the 9th boss wave comes 3 minutes after the previous wave.

Rogues can (chain) distract approaching bosses in order to provide a few more seconds of OOC time for boss prep.

You will leave combat the second you kill the previous trash wave. Again, mechanics are identical to black morass. If you don't feel comfortable with this sort of pacing, do us all a favour and run Heroic BM, or timed ZA runs.



==The Trash==
All trash can be CCed using appropriate class CCs (Shackle, Trap, Sheep, Fear). This is largely 'AOE trash.'

Features 4 unique types
*'''Ghouls''': 140k HP. Cannibalizes at low health (7%hp/tick heal). Low Melee hits (1-1.5k).
*'''Abominations''': 180k HP. Random stun. High Melee hits (3k). Poison Cloud Aura (750/tick).
*'''Necromancers''': 120k HP. Shadowbolt (2500ish damage). Cripple. Summon Skeletons**. Casts Unholy Frenzy*
**Unholy Frenzy - Increases an ally's attack speed by 100% for 20 sec, but also inflicts 500 nature damage to that ally every 2 sec. Can be stacked for some insane rogue single target DPS on harder trash (shouldn't be needed on rage). Needs to be dispelled otherwise.
**Summon Skeletons - Insignificant. Summons random 30k health skeletons that will be caught in the AOE.
*'''Crypt Fiends''': 170k HP. Medium Melee hits (2k). Web (Undispellable 10 second root).


Wave Descriptions:
*Wave 1 10 Ghouls 
*Wave 2 10 Ghouls, 2 Crypt Fiends 
*Wave 3 6 Ghouls, 6 Crypt Fiends 
*Wave 4 6 Ghouls, 4 Crypt Fiends, 2 Necromancers 
*Wave 5 2 Ghouls, 6 Crypt Fiends, 4 Necromancers 
*Wave 6 6 Ghouls, 6 Abominations 
*Wave 7 4 Ghouls, 4 Necromancers, 4 Abominations 
*Wave 8 6 Ghouls, 4 Crypt Fiends, 2 Abominations, 2 Necromancers

==Strategy==
The almost universal method/suggested strategy for clearing Hyjal trash is the frequent and repetitive abuse of prot paladins to AOE tank and DPS the majority of the trash. 

Tanking Assingments:
- Prot paladin(s) tanking as many Ghouls, Crypt Fiends as possible
- Ferals and Warriors tanking as many of the Abominations as possible
- Sheep as many Necromancers as possible / needed
- Shackle any leftover abominations

The obvious and intended goal is to blow away the large amount of crypt fiends/ghouls while avoiding the more dangerous targets. Key points I've found here is ensuring that your paladin tank who is on the mass of mobs does NOT have abomination aggro as a stun on the paladin while the other mobs beat on him means certain death due to lack of avoidance.

One key point on shadowy necromancer pulls, they will unleash a SB volley at the first target they see. Prot warriors up front during the pull while CC gets established. Spell reflect anything launched at you to provide a nice buffer (4 SBs coming at some poor mage is something yo uwant to avoid, obviously...)

Other than that, everything stated indicates a very clear cut and simple tank and spank type scenario.

==Kiting==
I can't really put this any clearer than a simple picture does. In short, a single hunter will be used to pull a single mob into the alliance NPC camps. Once the mob aggros the NPCs they will assist in the battle. They do horrendous damage but have a large life pool and will ease in the tanking/dps assignments required.


==DPS Order==
The priority targets in terms of raid danger are Necros > Abominations > Ghouls > Fiends. As such this also makes for an excellent initial kill target order. This is meant for single target DPS. AOE will be...AOEing, and attempting to address the 2nd biggest danger, which is a lack of enough raid DPS to exit combat fast enough and regen for the Nth rounds.

One point of danger and interest that I couldn't dig anything up on, is the danger/likelihood of having 3-5 AOEd ghouls begin to cannibalize at once, and whether or not a raid can put up enough AOE dps to counteract this. This will definitely be something to at least be aware of. The modifications to this if it becomes an issue are obvious. Due to low HP totals a single stun should buy the raid enough time to down a ghoul, but stun assignments/rotations will need to be devised if this issue occurs (I'm assuming it's not all too common as I found very little on it)

Honestly, it all sounds like a giant KZ gauntlet with shields and shim tanking the whole way through. Throw out minimal initial CC, wait for aggro, nuke down the mass targets while single targetting the big dangers. Nothing special needs to be done to necros/aboms while they are being tanked, other than fast single target DPS. The only 'in combat' non CC worries is the ghoul's cannibalize.

==Simulations/Conjecture==
Looking at the waves, there appear to be 2 'difficult' waves of trash. Here's in my mind how these would go down:
Wave 5 -- 2 Ghouls, 6 Crypt Fiends, 4 Necromancers
Ghouls/Crypt Fiends: Paper/Shields
Fen/Kiel/Nite/Kaerne/Flaxx: Backup stun duty on ghouls, tanking un CCed necros
N Mages: Initial sheep on Necros
AOE DPS: Ghouls/Fiends
Single Target DPS: Necros->Ghouls->Fiends

Pull -> Mages sheep necros -> Hunter kites a single ghoul to alliance NPC -> Paladins acquire AOE trash -> Tanks pick up any un CCed necros -> Single target downs necro(s), then moves to aoe trash -> AOE trash is down, by this time sheeps are up -> Single target down necros along with overlapping AOE if needed

It honestly seems all in the pull. The DPS order is clear and concise, and the only real dangers are the necromancers. Get a good pull/shadowbolt soak, solid CC off, and take out the necros fast. The only worry with the aoe trash is speed, and there is only so fast you can spam Seed/etc. The key here will be aoe from EVERYONE. Hurricane, Traps, consecrate (including holy paladins), ec.

Single target should be able to take out the necros before they do any noticeable raid damage.


Wave 7 -- 4 Ghouls, 4 Necromancers, 4 Abominations

Paper: Ghouls
Shields: 1-2 Aboms
Fen/Kiel/Nite/Kaerne/Flaxx: Remaining Aboms + tanking unCCed necros
N Mages: Initial sheep on Necros
AOE DPS: Ghouls/Fiends
Single Target DPS: Necros->Aboms->Ghouls

Key here seems to be balancing the CC load moreso with the tanking load. If we can manage to keep 3 or even 4 of the necros CCed and free up most of the warriors/druids to tank aboms, we can get a solid enough tanking assignment on all non necros to AOE down ALL the ghouls/aboms at once. Again seems to be all in the pull.

Obviously we'll see a lot of what we can and can't do when we get in there (Maybe we are overestimating adds, and a single prot paladin can tank all the aboms), or maybe it's a bit harder than described by t6 guilds and we'll need more help on the aoe adds. No one knows yet, but I think going in with a mindset of what needs to be done based on mob type will help. We can adjust tanking/healing as needed, adn all that really affects is how fast or how many mobs go down. Knowing how to take them down and in what order will provide more immediate returns.

If you get nothing else out of this, at least get this part

The single most important deal about Hyjal is preparation. There's a reason I'm posting this even though I'm not 100% solid on some of the mechanics. I come off like I know what i'm talking about because I want people to challenge me and put thought into some of these encounters and come up with a better plan. EVERYONE in the raid needs to be prepared for Hyjal when we get there. Maybe we won't go in week one 2.4, maybe we won't go in until Kael dies. Who knows. 2.4 isn't even here yet. And yet I'm still posting this, because Hyjal is different from SSC, TK, ZA, every other zone we've done. We don't have time for a 5 minute overview before a boss, or a 10 minute rundown. You zone in, trash comes at you, and if you are good enough to make it to the last wave, you've got 3 minutes from the pull (probably 1 - 1.5 minutes after the last wave is down) to prepare for the boss. Prepare means rebuff if needed, finalize group tweaks, MAYBE throw out a ready check. There isn't time to go over the strat, so you need to know it.

I'm not posting the winterchill strat, but I'm sure one of the other R/D regulars will. Go out and read the strat if you have time on your own though, it's a very simple fight.

Oh, and get your Medallion of the Alliance. Please please please pleaeeeseeeeeeeee.
